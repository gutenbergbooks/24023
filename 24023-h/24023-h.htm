<br>
THE RISE OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT<br>
<br>
[1900]<br>
<br>
Theodore Roosevelt was born in New York City, October 27, 1858. He was<br>
graduated from Harvard in 1880. At the age of twenty-three he entered<br>
the New York State Assembly, where he served six years with great<br>
credit. Two years he was a "cowboy" in Dakota. He was United States<br>
Civil Service Commissioner and President of the New York City Police<br>
Board. In 1897 he became Assistant Secretary of the Navy, holding this<br>
position long enough to indite the despatch which took Dewey to Manila.<br>
He then raised the first United States Volunteer Cavalry, commonly<br>
spoken of as "Rough Riders," and went to Cuba as their<br>
lieutenant-colonel. Gallantry at Las Guasimas made him their colonel,<br>
the first colonel, Leonard Wood, having received a brigadier-general's<br>
commission. Returning from the war, Colonel Roosevelt found himself, as<br>
by a magic metamorphosis, Governor of his State, fighting civic battles<br>
against growing corporate abuses. He urged compulsory publicity for the<br>
affairs of monopolistic combinations, and was prominently instrumental<br>
in the enactment of the New York Franchise Tax Law.<br>
<br>
The party managers in the 1900 convention hoped by making him<br>
Vice-President to remove him from competition for the presidency in<br>
1904. But the most unexpected of the many swift transitions in his<br>
career foiled their calculations and brought him in a moment to the<br>
summit of a citizen's ambition.<br>
<br>
The new chief magistrate was no less honest, fearless, or<br>
public-spirited than the recent one; it only remained to be seen whether<br>
he were not less astute and cautious. Coming to the office as he did, he<br>
was absolutely unfettered, which, in one of so frank a temperament,<br>
might prove a danger. He was more popular with the people than with<br>
politicians. Though highly educated and used to the best associations,<br>
he was more approachable than any of his predecessors. At a public<br>
dinner which he attended, one round of cheers was given him as "the<br>
President of the United States" another as "Roosevelt," and a third as<br>
"Teddy." Had McKinley been in his place a corresponding variation would<br>
have been unthinkable.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
President Roosevelt's temper and method were in pointed contrast to<br>
McKinley's. Whereas McKinley seemed simply to hold the tiller, availing<br>
himself of currents that to the eye deviously, yet easily and<br>
inevitably, bore him to his objective, Roosevelt strenuously plied the<br>
oar, recking little of cross currents or head winds, if, indeed, he did<br>
not delight in them. Chauncey Depew aptly styled McKinley "a Western man<br>
with Eastern ideas." Roosevelt, "an Eastern man with Western ideas."<br>
This aspect of the new President's character gave him hold on both West<br>
and East. Roosevelt was the first President since William Henry Harrison<br>
to bring to his office the vigor and freshness of the frontier, as he<br>
was, anomalously, the first city-born or wealthy-born incumbent.<br>

<br>
<br>
[1901]<br>
<br>
The members of President McKinley's cabinet were invited to retain their<br>
portfolios, which they agreed to do. At the time, Roosevelt was reputed<br>
to be the foremost civil service reformer in the country. Politicians<br>
were&nbsp; soon made aware that the President regarded fitness for
office as<br>
the first test. Unfortunately during the presidency of McKinley, some<br>
8000 offices had been taken out of the competitive lists. During<br>
Roosevelt's first term, however, the list of offices placed under the<br>
merit system was greatly extended. Within the twenty-one years from the<br>
enactment of the first national civil service reform law wonders had<br>
been accomplished in that more than one-half of the 300,000 offices in<br>
the executive civil service were placed in the classified competitive<br>
service.<br>
<br>
President Roosevelt stood for liberal reciprocity with Cuba, urging<br>
this, at first, with results disastrous to party harmony. He was<br>
vindicated by public opinion, but learned wisdom. Though believed to be<br>
favorable to a decided easing of custom-house levies, his administration<br>
soon frankly avowed itself unable to proceed further than high-<br>
protectionists would follow. The evidence of his tariff convictions won<br>
him strong support in the West, which was prepared to go greater lengths<br>
than he. In the congressional campaign of 1902, ex-Speaker Henderson, of<br>
Iowa, a stanch protectionist, withdrew from public life, as was<br>
supposed, rather than misrepresent himself by acceding to tariff reform<br>
or his constituents by opposing it.<br>
<br>
Mr. Roosevelt signalized his accession by an effort to make the federal<br>
anti-trust law something more than a cumberer of the statute-book. His<br>
inaugural message and innumerable addresses of his boldly handled the<br>
whole trust evil and called for the regulation of capitalistic<br>
combinations in the interest of the public.<br>
<br>
Appreciation of the President's attitude on these matters may be<br>
assisted by some notice of the then threatening vigor and universality<br>
of the movement toward industrial combination. Mr. Beck, Assistant<br>
Attorney-General of the United States, declared in 1892:<br>
<br>
"Excessive capitalization of corporations, dishonest management by their<br>
executive officers, the destruction of the rights of the minority, the<br>
theft of public utilities, the subordination of public interests to<br>
private gain, the debauchery of our local legislatures and executive<br>
officers, and the corruption of the elective franchise, have resulted<br>
from the facility afforded by the law to corporations to concentrate the<br>
control of colossal wealth in the hands of a few men . . . . The<br>
question presses ever more importunately for decision whether these<br>
marvellous aggregations of capital can be subordinated to the very laws<br>
which created them."<br>
<br>
Legislation in many States, the enactment of the Sherman anti-trust law<br>
by Congress, and the decision of the Supreme Court in the Trans-Missouri<br>
case rendered insecure trust agreements of the old type, in which<br>
constituent corporations surrendered the control of their affairs to<br>
trustees. But the current merely shifted to a different channel, the<br>
trust proper giving way to the giant corporation having the same aims,<br>
methods, and efficiency, while, as more legal, it was less vulnerable.<br>
<br>
In the railway world, "community of interest" assumed the place of<br>
pooling agreements. The Union Pacific acquired large holdings from<br>
Collis P. Huntington's estate and controlled the Southern Pacific. The<br>
power behind the Southern Railway got control of nearly all the other<br>
Southern railways, including the Atlantic Coast Line, the Plant System,<br>
and at last even the Louisville and Nashville. The New York Central<br>
dominated the other Vanderbilt roads. The Pennsylvania secured decisive<br>
amounts of Baltimore and Ohio stock, as well as weighty interests in the<br>
Chesapeake and Ohio and the Norfolk and Western, and so on.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Great banking establishments, foremost among them the house of J. P.<br>
Morgan &amp; Co., took to financing these schemes. Morgan re-organized
the<br>
Northern Pacific, and it would forthwith have pooled issues with the<br>
Great Northern but for opposition by the State of Minnesota. James J.<br>
Hill was master of the Great Northern, and confidence existed between<br>
him and Morgan.<br>
<br>
They wished a secure outlet for the products of the Northwest, also<br>
access to Chicago over a line of their own. After a survey of the field<br>
the promoters selected as the most available for the latter office the<br>
Chicago, Burlington and Quincy. Purchase of shares in this corporation<br>
was quietly begun. Soon the Burlington road was apparently in hand.<br>
Prices rose.<br>
<br>

The Union Pacific control perceived in the aggression of the two<br>
northern lines a menace to its northwestern and Pacific coast<br>
connections. The Union Pacific leader, E. H. Harriman, resorted to an<br>
unexpected coup. He attempted to purchase the Northern Pacific,<br>
Burlington and all. A mysterious demand, set Northern Pacific shares<br>
soaring. The stock reached $1,000 a share and none was obtainable. Panic<br>
arose; bankers and brokers faced ruin.<br>
<br>
The two sides now declared a truce. The Northern Securities Company was<br>
created, with a capital approaching a billion dollars, to take over the<br>
Burlington, Northern Pacific, and Great Northern stocks.<br>

<br>
The States of Minnesota and Washington, unable in their own courts to<br>
thwart this plan, sought the intervention of the United States Supreme<br>
Court. Their suit was vain till the Administration came to the rescue.<br>
At the instance of the Attorney-General, an injunction issued from the<br>
high court named forbidding the Securities Company to receive the<br>
control of the roads, and the holders of the railroad stocks involved to<br>
give it over. It was observed, however, that at the very time of the<br>
above proceedings the Southern Railways' power obtained control of the<br>
Louisville and Nashville without jar or judicial obstruction.<br>
<br>
While general, the process of confederation was specially conspicuous in<br>
the iron and steel trade. In rapid succession the National Steel<br>
Company, the American Sheet Steel Company, and the American Tin Plate<br>
Company were each made up of numerous smaller plants. Each of these<br>
corporations, with a capital from $12,000,000 to $40,000,000, owned the<br>
mines, the ships, and the railways for hauling its products, the mills<br>
for manufacturing, and the agencies for sale. Through the efforts of<br>
John W. Gates numerous wire and nail works were combined into the<br>
American Steel and Wire Company. The Federal Steel Company, the American<br>
Bridge Company, the Republic Iron and Steel Company, huge and complete,<br>
were dictators each in its field.<br>

The Carnegie Steel Company long remained independent. Determined not to<br>
enter a "combine," Andrew Carnegie sought to fortify his position. He<br>
obtained a fleet of ships upon the lakes, purchased mines, undertook to<br>
construct tube works at Conneaut, Ohio, and planned for railroads. A<br>
battle of the giants, with loss and possible ruin for one side or the<br>
other, impended. Carnegie was finally willing to sell. Hence, the United<br>
States Steel Corporation capitalized for a billion dollars. Carnegie and<br>
his partners were said to receive about $300,000,000 in bonds of the new<br>
corporation, while the other trusts and the promoters absorbed the stock<br>
for their properties and services. The underwriting syndicate probably<br>
realized $25,000,000.<br>

The trust creators extended their operations abroad. In 1901 J. Pierpont<br>
Morgan and associates acquired the Leyland line of Atlantic<br>
steamships. British nerves had not recovered tone when a steamship<br>
combination, embracing not only American and British but also German<br>
lines and ship-building firms at Belfast and on the Clyde was announced.<br>
Of the great Atlantic companies, only the Cunard line remained<br>
independent. Parliamentary and ministerial assurances of governmental<br>
attention only emphasized the strength of the association.<br>

<br>
<br>
One effect of this organization at home was to place the Ship Subsidy<br>
Bill, which passed the Senate in 1901, for the time, at least, on the<br>
table. The sentiment of the country, especially of the Middle West,<br>
would not permit the payment of public money to a concern commercially<br>
able to defy Britannia on the sea.<br>
<br>
The Yankee Peril confronted Londoners when they saw American capital<br>
securing control of their proposed underground transit system. At their<br>
tables they beheld the output of food trusts. One of these, the<br>
so-called Beef Trust, called down upon itself in 1902 domestic as well<br>
as foreign anathema.<br>
<br>
The failure of the corn crop in 1900, together with a scarcity of<br>
cattle, tended to raise the price of beef. In 1902 outcry became<br>
emphatic. Advance in meat values drew forcibly to view the control held<br>
by six slaughtering concerns acting in unison.<br>
<br>
The President ordered an investigation, and, as a result, proceedings<br>
under the Sherman Act to restrain the great packers from continuing<br>
their alleged combination. A temporary injunction was granted. The slow<br>
machinery of chancery bade fair to work out a decree, but long before it<br>
was on record, alert spirits among the packing firms evolved a new plan<br>
not obnoxious to decrees, but effective for union.<br>
<br>
If the public suffered from these phalanxed industries while they ran<br>
smoothly, it endured peculiar evils from the periodical conflicts<br>
between the capital and the labor engaged in them.<br>
<br>
The Steel Strike of 1901 was a conflict over the unionizing of certain<br>
hitherto non-union plants of the United States Steel Corporation. It<br>
resulted in defeat for the strikers and in the disunionizing of plants.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
This strike had no such consequences for the consuming public as<br>
attended the anthracite coal strike of 1902, which was more bitterly<br>
fought in that it was a conflict over wages. The standard of living had<br>
been lowered in one of the coal-fields by the introduction of cheap<br>
foreign labor. Now the same process threatened the other coal-field.<br>
<br>
A strike ordered by the United Mine Workers began May 12, 1902, when one<br>
hundred and forty-seven thousand miners went out. Though the record was<br>
marred at places, they behaved well and retained to a large degree<br>
public sympathy. When the price of anthracite rose from about $5 a ton<br>
to $28 and $30, the parts of the country using hard coal were threatened<br>
with a fuel famine and had begun to realize it. For the five months<br>
ending October 12th, the strike was estimated to have cost over<br>
$126,000,000. The operators stubbornly refused to arbitrate or to<br>
recognize the union, and the miners, with equal constancy, held their<br>
ranks intact.<br>

<br>
The problem of protecting the public pressed for solution as never<br>
before. The only suggestion at first discussed was arbitration. Enforced<br>
arbitration could not be effected in the absence of contract without<br>
infringing the workingman's right to labor or to decline to do so; in<br>
other words, without reducing him, in case of adverse decision by<br>
arbitration, to a condition of involuntary servitude. It looked as<br>
though no solution would be reached unless State or nation should<br>
condemn and acquire ample portions of the mining lands to be worked<br>
under its own auspices and in a just manner. This course was suggested,<br>
but nearly all deemed it dangerously radical; nor was it as yet likely<br>
to be adopted by Congress or by the Pennsylvania legislature, should<br>
these powers be called to deal with the problem.<br>
<br>
On October 3 President Roosevelt called the coal operators and President<br>
Mitchell of the United Mine Workers to a conference at the White House,<br>
urging them to agree. His effort, at first seeming unsuccessful, was<br>
much criticised, but very few failed to praise it when, a few days<br>
later, it was found to have succeeded completely. An able and impartial<br>
commission, satisfactory to both sides, was appointed by the President<br>
to act as arbitrator, both miners and operators agreeing to abide its<br>
decrees. The miners, the four hundred thousand women and children<br>
dependent on them, the poor beginning to suffer from cold, indeed the<br>
whole nation, including, no doubt, the operators, felt relief.<br>
<br>
"How much better," said the young President, once, addressing a<br>
fashionable assembly, "boldly to attempt remedying a bad situation than<br>
to sit quietly in one's retreat, sigh, and think how good it would be if<br>
the situation could be remedied!"<br>

<br>
The sentiment noted at the end of the last chapter seemed to be the<br>
motive of Mr. Roosevelt's public life. Not only was he better informed<br>
on the whole than almost any President who had sat in the chair before,<br>
but he was a good lawyer, familiar with national and general history and<br>
awake to all contemporary doings, questions, and interests south, west,<br>
east, and abroad. He was also more a man of action and affairs than any<br>
of his predecessors. He had, in a very high degree, alertness, energy,<br>
courage, initiative, dispatch. Physically as well as mentally vigorous,<br>
he read much, heard all who could usefully inform him, apprehended<br>
easily, decided quickly, and toiled like Hercules. He was just and<br>
catholic in spirit, appreciating whatever was good in any section of the<br>
country or class of people. He respected precedent but was not its<br>
slave. Rather than walk always in ruts with never a jolt, he preferred<br>
some risks of tumbling over hummocks. Few public men of any age or<br>
country have more fully met Aristotle's test of a statesman: "ability to<br>
see facts as they exist and to do the things needing to be done."<br>

John Hay, Secretary of State. [Died July 1, 1905.]<br>
<br>
<br>
He had able aids; pre-eminent among these were John Hay, Secretary of<br>
State, and Elihu Root, Secretary of War. Each was, to say the least,<br>
the peer of his greatest predecessors in his office. It was mainly to<br>
Mr. Root that we were indebted for starting the Cubans prosperously as<br>
an independent nation. His service for the Philippines so far as it went<br>
was not less distinguished; and he effected vitally important<br>
reorganization and reform in the war office.<br>
<br>
A well co-ordinated plan was developed whereby army officers were given<br>
advanced training in the various branches of military science as in the<br>
European countries. Neither the President nor Secretary Root advocated a<br>
large standing army, but they both strove to bring the army "to the very<br>
highest point of efficiency of any army in the civilized world." The<br>
ability of Secretary Root to inaugurate reforms in a department which<br>
when he became its head was overridden by tradition, was well expressed<br>
by President Roosevelt as follows: "Elihu Root is the ablest man I have<br>
known in our governmental service. I will go further. He is the greatest<br>
man that has appeared in the public life of any country, in any<br>
position, on either side of the ocean in my time."<br>

<br>
Under Secretary Hay our State Department attained unprecedented<br>
prestige, due in part to the higher position among the nations now<br>
accorded us. This result itself Mr. Hay had done much to achieve; and he<br>
passed hardly a month in his office without making some further addition<br>
to the renown and influence of his country. If the United States<br>
has--which may be doubted--raised up diplomatists with Mr. Hay's mastery<br>
of international law and practice and his art and skill in conducting<br>
delicate negotiations, we have probably never had his equal in<br>
diplomatic initiative, or in the thorough preparation and presentation<br>
of cases. He did not meet occasions merely but made them, not<br>
arbitrarily but for the world's good. Settling the Alaskan boundary<br>
favorably to the United States at every point save one, crumbling with<br>
the single stroke of his Pauncefote treaty that Clayton-Bulwer rock on<br>
which Evarts, Blaine, and Frelinghuysen in turn had tried dynamite in<br>
vain, were deeds seldom matched in statecraft.<br>
<br>
By an act of Congress, in 1903, a new member was added to the<br>
President's cabinet in the person of the Secretary of the Department of<br>
Commerce and Labor. George B. Cortelyou was the first man appointed to<br>
that office. Two bureaus, those of corporations and of manufactures,<br>
were created for the department. The other bureaus, such as the Bureau<br>
of Statistics, Bureau of Standards of Weights and Measures and Coast and<br>
Geodetic Survey, were transferred from the other departments. The place<br>
of this new department was defined by the President in the following:<br>
"to aid in strengthening our domestic and foreign markets, in perfecting<br>
our transportation facilities, in building up our merchant marine, in<br>
preventing the entrance of undesirable immigrants, in improving<br>
commercial and industrial conditions, and in bringing together on common<br>
ground those necessary partners in industrial progress--capital and<br>
labor."<br>

Among the problems engaging President Roosevelt none was of wider<br>
interest than the construction of an Atlantic-Pacific canal. A<br>
commission of nine, Rear-Admiral Walker its head, had been set by<br>
President McKinley to find the best route. It began investigation in<br>
the summer of 1899, visiting Paris to examine the claims of the French<br>
Panama Company, and also Nicaragua and Panama. It surveyed, platted,<br>
took borings, and made a minute and valuable report upon the work which<br>
each of the proposed canals would require.<br>
<br>

<br>
The most practicable routes were Nicaragua and Panama. The Nicaragua way<br>
was between three and four times the longer--183 miles to 49; 38 hours<br>
from ocean to ocean as against 12. The Panama way was straighter, had<br>
less elevation at its summit, and required fewer locks. Congress finally<br>
decided to construct a high level lock-canal. The cost of keeping up and<br>
operating a Panama canal was estimated at six-tenths that of one across<br>
Nicaragua. Harbor expenses and facilities would be nearly the same for<br>
both lines. The time required for construction, probably nine or ten<br>
years, would be a trifle the less at Nicaragua. Control works, to keep<br>
always the proper depth of water in the canal, could be more easily<br>
maintained at Panama.<br>
<br>
Panama political and commercial complications were serious. The isthmus<br>
was Colombia territory, and, since October, 1899, a civil war had been<br>
raging in that republic. Its financial condition was desperate. Two<br>
hundred million inconvertible paper pesos had depreciated to the value<br>
of two cents each in gold, yet were legal tender for all obligations. In<br>
such a country, especially as war was in progress, the only government<br>
able to maintain itself was despotic. Civil troubles were intensified by<br>
dissension between Catholics and Protestants. Revolution accompanied any<br>
change in administration.<br>
<br>
Under Ferdinand de Lesseps, creator of the Suez Canal, the French<br>
company had performed extensive excavations at Panama. The New Panama<br>
Canal Company of France held certain concessions from the Colombian<br>
government. The value of its assets was $109,000,000 at most. If we dug<br>
at Nicaragua these would be worth little. Besides, a Nicaragua canal<br>
completed, some $6,000,000 of stock owned by the French company in the<br>
Panama railroad would dwindle in value.<br>
<br>
The validity of the French company's rights was questioned. Its<br>
agreement to work some each year had not been kept. Its charter was to<br>
expire in October, 1904, but, for 5,000,000 francs, the Colombia<br>
President granted a six-year extension. Even with this the French<br>
franchise would revert to Colombia in 1910. Colombia wished delay. The<br>
United States transcontinental railroads did not want a canal, as it<br>
would divert from them heavy, bulky, and imperishable freight. They<br>
therefore joined Colombia in seeking delay, playing off the Nicaragua<br>
plan against the Panama, hoping to defeat both.<br>
<br>
Late in 1901, newspapers in the United States began urging the purchase<br>
from Colombia of a land belt across the isthmus to be United States<br>
territory. Our Senate, December 16, 1901, by a vote of 72 to 6, ratified<br>
the Hay-Pauncefote treaty with Great Britain, in which it was agreed<br>
that we should build a canal, allowing all other nations to use it.<br>
Meantime, spite of the fact that the Walker commission had recommended<br>
Nicaragua route, public sentiment began to favor Panama. Even the Walker<br>
commission changed to this view.<br>
<br>
The Spooner act of Congress, approved June 28, 1902, authorized the<br>
President to build an isthmian canal. The Panama properties and<br>
franchises were to be bought if he could get good title and also obtain<br>
the fee of a right of way from Colombia; otherwise he must pierce<br>
Nicaragua. The act provided for all necessary funds. The French<br>
company's claims were investigated, pronounced valid, and in due time<br>
acquired by the United States.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Effort to secure from Colombia the required territorial rights was made<br>
in the proposed Hay-Herran treaty, ratified by our Senate, 73 against 5,<br>
March 17, 1903, under which we were to pay Colombia, besides an annual<br>
rental $10,000,000 for the lease of a belt six miles wide from sea to<br>
sea. August 17, 1903, the Colombian Senate rejected this treaty, and,<br>
October 18, the government of that country proposed another, involving<br>
the payment by us of $25,000,000 instead of $10,000,000. If we offered<br>
this, would not the price rise to $30,000,000 or more?<br>
<br>
Papers in the United States argued for a revolution in Panama. The<br>
isthmus, it was urged, was in time nearer to Washington than to Bogota.<br>
All Panama interests centred in the canal. Should Nicaragua get the<br>
canal, Colon and Panama would be deserted. Both places owed their peace<br>
to the presence of our navy. On the principle that treaties concerning<br>
territory run with the territory, ignoring changes of sovereignty, our<br>
time-honored obligation to keep peace on the isthmus, bound us, if<br>
Panama set up for herself, to protect her even against Colombia. England<br>
would concur. English ships would use the canal more than ours. Great<br>
Britain, risking and spending nothing, would gain incalculably. France,<br>
too, would acquiesce. The Frenchmen got some $40,000,000 if the canal<br>
crossed Panama but lost everything if it passed to Nicaragua. Other<br>
European nations wished the canal built and felt that now was the<br>
accepted time. Latin-American States alone showed sympathy with<br>
Colombia.<br>

<br>
Revolution took place. On the afternoon of November 3, 1903, the Panama<br>
city council declared that city independent of Colombia. Colon followed.<br>
A provisional Panama government was organized. November 6 we recognized<br>
Panama as an independent State. November 7 she appointed M.<br>
Bunau-Varilla her diplomatic agent at Washington. November 13 he was, as<br>
such, formally received by President Roosevelt. November 18 Secretary<br>
Hay and M. Bunau-Varilla signed a treaty whose first article read: "The<br>
United States guarantees and will maintain the independence of the<br>
Republic of Panama." Articles II and III gave us, in effect, sovereignty<br>
over a ten-mile wide canal zone between the oceans. This treaty was<br>
ratified by Panama December 2, and by our Senate February 23, 1904.<br>
November 16, 1903, Colombia protested to Great Britain against our<br>
action, and, November 28, offered us a canal concession free if we would<br>
permit her to subjugate Panama.<br>
<br>
Both at home and abroad the administration was charged with sharp<br>
practice for its Panama coup, and the case made out by critics was prima<br>
facie strong--less, indeed, on its legal than on its ethical and<br>
prudential side. We had allowed ourselves to profit by Colombia's<br>
distress, encouraged secession in federal republics like our own, and<br>
rendered ourselves and our Monroe doctrine objects of dread throughout<br>
Central and South America. Still, Colombia had been so stiff and greedy<br>
and the settlement was in the main so happy, that censure soon subsided.<br>
All the powerful nations speedily followed our example and recognized<br>
Panama's independence.<br>

Great heaps of wreckage piled high by the Galveston disaster.<br>
<br>
<br>
In September, 1900, the city of Galveston was visited by one of the<br>
greatest disasters known in American history. A fierce storm swept the<br>
waters of the gulf over the island on which Galveston is situated,<br>
destroying property aggregating many millions of dollars and causing the<br>
loss of 6,000 lives out of the total population of 37,000. For a time it<br>
seemed that the site of the city would have to be abandoned, for the<br>
highest land on which buildings stood was but a few feet above the<br>
highest waves. It was determined, however, to build a stone wall three<br>
miles in length which should be massive enough to protect the city from<br>
any similar attack. Its top, which is five feet thick, is three feet<br>
above the highest point reached by the water. The bottom of the wall is<br>
sixteen feet thick. This wall, which is built concave toward the gulf,<br>
is protected by earth and stone filled in for two hundred feet, thus<br>
providing a driveway thirty feet wide with walks on either side,<br>
beautified with trees and shrubs.<br>

<br>
<br>
The management of public affairs during the rebuilding of the city was<br>
entrusted to a committee of experts. So efficiently and economically was<br>
the administration of the government, that the Galveston Plan, commonly<br>
spoken of as the Commission Plan, soon became a model for municipal<br>
organization. A modification of this plan was soon put into operation at<br>
Des Moines, Iowa. This plan consists of government by five salaried<br>
persons, one of them acting as mayor. This body performs both<br>
legislative and executive duties, each member being in charge of a<br>
department of the city government. The arguments in favor of this type<br>
of government are: (1) Responsibility is easily located; (2) a few men<br>
receive such salaries that they may be expected to give their whole time<br>
to the duties of their offices; (3) more civic interest will be aroused.<br>
All officers are subject to removal at any time by vote of a certain<br>
proportion of the people.<br>
<br>
The Cuban government was organized in the spring of 1902. On May 20 of<br>
that year, Governor-General Wood for the United States turned over the<br>
government house at Havana to President Tomaso Estrada y Palma.<br>
<br>
The ceremonies attending the transfer were impressive. A letter from<br>
President Roosevelt addressed to the President and the Congress of the<br>
Republic of Cuba was handed to President Palma. This declared the<br>
occupation of Cuba by the United States to be at an end and tendered the<br>
sincere friendship and good wishes of this country. At noon General Wood<br>
hauled down the American flag, which had floated above the Governor's<br>
palace at Havana, and assisted General Gomez in raising to the breeze<br>
the red triangle with central silver star and three blue and two white<br>
stripes constituting the flag of the new republic. All of the foreign<br>
ships in the harbor likewise ran up the Cuban flag in honor of the<br>
occasion. Forty-five shots, one for each State in the Union, were fired<br>
as the stars and stripes were lowered from Morro Castle and the other<br>
fortresses. The American troops saluted the new emblem, fired twenty-one<br>
guns in honor of the new nation, and then embarked for the United<br>
States. Thus was kept to the letter--a noble example of public<br>
faith--the promise we made when invading Cuba, that we would not acquire<br>
territory.<br>

<br>
Those who prophesied a short life for the new republic and a reign of<br>
fraud and corruption were mistaken. During the first year economy became<br>
the rule in the administration of all branches of the public service,<br>
the government was self supporting, and a balance accumulated in the<br>
treasury. Moreover, the reforms inaugurated by Americans continued. Some<br>
3,400 teachers were employed in the island and 120,000 pupils were in<br>
constant attendance upon the schools. In all parts of the island the<br>
effects of American rule were visible. Ten million dollars had been<br>
expended in sanitation reforms and the cleansing of Havana and the other<br>
cities. Industrial schools for orphan boys and girls were begun and<br>
hospitals and asylums for the sick, helpless, and insane were<br>
reestablished. By 1901 a railroad, with branch lines, was constructed<br>
between Santiago and Havana, thus giving the whole island excellent<br>
transportation facilities.<br>
<br>
Cuba could not gain prosperity at a bound. Whereas the island should,<br>
under natural conditions, have had $30,000,000 to $40,000,000 due her<br>
from foreign countries in 1902, she was $50,000,000 in debt. Her<br>
manufactures were insignificant. It was estimated that, in the year<br>
named, $80,000,000 of American money was invested in Cuba. The main<br>
enterprises were railroads, sugar and tobacco plantations, mines, and<br>
fruit farms.<br>
<br>
Free commercial intercourse with Spain no longer existing, Cuban sugar<br>
and tobacco producers sought markets in the United States, leading to<br>
the "reciprocity" conflict touched upon in Chapter XIII, Vol. V. During<br>
1902 a reciprocity treaty was negotiated and promptly ratified in Cuba.<br>
Our Senate amended it and returned it to Cuba for reconsideration.<br>
Brought hither again, it was passed by our Senate in December, 1903.<br>
President Roosevelt signed it December 17, declaring its provisions<br>
effective in ten days.<br>
<br>
The Philippine Commission (Chapter XV, Vol. V), four Americans and three<br>
islanders, at first enacted laws by the authority of the President as<br>
Commander-in-Chief. After the Congressional Act of July 1, 1902, the<br>
formula ran: "By authority of the United States be it enacted by the<br>
Philippine Commission." The government was pronouncedly civil both in<br>
nature and in spirit, the natives being gradually placated, and only an<br>
occasional outbreak demanding the presence of troops. Schools were<br>
established, the English language and American ideas of government and<br>
business introduced. No promise of Philippine independence was given,<br>
yet the tenor of our whole policy toward the Filipinos, of official<br>
utterances and of public sentiment relating to them, was to the effect<br>
that we should never look upon any of the islands as a crown colony.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The same interests that forbade Cuban reciprocity opposed tariff<br>
concessions to the Philippines. A 25 per cent reduction from the Dingley<br>
rates was the best that Congress would grant, though the commission<br>
besought one of at least 75 per cent. For a time our behavior in this<br>
too much resembled English and Spanish dealings with colonies centuries<br>
ago. The United States acquired from the Philippine religious orders<br>
422,337 acres of land, three-fifths of it highly cultivated and thickly<br>
inhabited, for $7,239,000. In all, the government owned about 61,000,000<br>
out of the perhaps 70,000,000 acres of land in the islands. Of the<br>
government lands, 40,000,000 acres were forest.<br>
<br>
The law of July 1, 1902, to supplement the commission, provided for a<br>
native assembly of not more than 100 members or less than 50, with<br>
annual sessions of 90 days. Municipal autonomy was allowed and became<br>
common. An efficient constabulary was established, also a Philippine<br>
mint and coinage system on a gold basis. Careful exploitation of the<br>
agricultural, mineral, and other resources of the islands was provided<br>
for, as well as an increasing number of public improvements in the<br>
interest of order, health, and cleanliness. To promote investment in the<br>
Philippine public works, 4 per cent bonds were issued, guaranteed by the<br>
United States.<br>

Preparatory to forming the Philippine Assembly the commission took a<br>
census of the islands. In 1905 the population returned from 342 islands<br>
was 7,635,426. Of this number only about 9 per cent were wild tribes,<br>
though more than half the entire population could neither read nor write<br>
in any language. Of the 370,000 pupils in the newly established schools,<br>
or double the number in attendance two years previously, one in nine on<br>
the average had some understanding of English. Twelve thousand adults<br>
were in the night schools, chiefly engaged in acquiring the English<br>
language.<br>

rendered unfit for occupancy. The loss in buildings and other property<br>
destroyed was about $75,000,000. With a few exceptions, the financial<br>
district of the city was burned. For a time it was feared that the<br>
losses would be so great that restoration could not be made, but new<br>
plans were projected which included broader streets and better<br>
buildings. Instead of a decrease in the number of business concerns,<br>
there was an increase through the entrance of firms from the outside.<br>

THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE EXPOSITION.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis was opened April 30,<br>
1904, and continued for seven months. It commemorated the acquisition of<br>
the Louisiana territory which was consummated April 30, 1803, marking<br>
one of the greatest events in American history. Out of this area had<br>
been carved thirteen States and two territories wherein over 17,000,000<br>
people were making their homes.<br>
<br>
The design for the exposition represented the work of ten of the most<br>
distinguished architects of the country. The buildings, grouped in<br>
perfect taste, mostly of noble style, had 128 acres of floor space, far<br>
beyond that at the disposal of any preceding fair. The grounds also were<br>
unprecedentedly ample and beautifully diversified, containing about<br>
1,200 acres. The total attendance, 18,741,073, fell short of that at<br>
Chicago in 1893 by over 8,000,000.<br>
<br>
The general plan of the exposition was intended to symbolize the history<br>
of the Louisiana territory representing the successive occupants of the<br>
soil--the wild animals; the&nbsp; Indians; the discoverers; the
explorers;<br>
the hunters; the trappers, and the pioneers. The aim was to make it one<br>
vast educational object lesson. To that end there were extensive<br>
exhibits from thirty States and from the chief cities of work done in<br>
the primary and secondary schools and in the universities and colleges<br>
of the country. This feature culminated in the International Congress of<br>
Arts and Sciences. Over 100 of the leading scholars from England,<br>
France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Japan, the United States, and a number<br>
of other countries made addresses and took part in the various<br>
discussions. All the fields of human knowledge were represented by these<br>
specialists.<br>
<br>
One feature of this exposition was unique: it represented to an<br>
unprecedented extent processes in lieu of products or in addition to<br>
them. Every day at almost every point something was literally doing,<br>
going on. Machinery whizzed, mines were operated, artists were at work,<br>
experts showed their craft; Indians, Filipinos, the blind, deaf, and<br>
dumb were taught.<br>

PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1904<br>
<br>
[1904]<br>
<br>
The Republican convention met at Chicago, June 21, and on June 23<br>
nominated Theodore Roosevelt for President. President Roosevelt's<br>
nomination was a certainty from the beginning. This action was demanded<br>
by the rank and file of Republicans, for his achievements were popular.<br>
Among the problems which he had helped to solve were those growing out<br>
of the war with Spain; settlement of the anthracite coal strike;<br>
creation of the Department of Commerce and Labor; and the investigation<br>
and prosecution of dishonesty in the post-office department.<br>
<br>
<br>

Charles W. Fairbanks,<br>
Vice-President of the United States.<br>
<br>
<br>
Plans for the convention had all been matured in advance with the<br>
exception of the selection of a candidate for Vice-President. By the<br>
time the convention assembled the opinion was general that for<br>
geographical reasons some one from Indiana should be named for this<br>
office. Charles Warren Fairbanks, a leading lawyer in Indianapolis, who<br>
was serving his second term in the United States Senate, was nominated<br>
without any real opposition. He had served as a member of the Joint High<br>
Commission to adjust international questions of moment between the<br>
United States and Great Britain. Grover Cleveland and William Jennings<br>
Bryan had declared they would not be candidates for the presidency and<br>
the Democratic party was in a dilemma. Both the conservative and the<br>
radical elements of the party declared they would write the platform and<br>
name the candidates. Alton Brooks Parker, Chief Judge of the Court of<br>
Appeals of New York, who was supported by Grover Cleveland, came<br>
gradually into prominence as the candidate of the conservatives and<br>
William Randolph Hearst of the radicals.<br>

The Republican convention at Chicago, 1904.<br>
<br>
<br>
The chief contest came in the Democratic convention of New York. There<br>
Judge Parker was supported by David B. Hill, ex-United States senator,<br>
and August Belmont, a New York banker. In consequence it was declared by<br>
the opposition that Judge Parker was the candidate of the trusts, Wall<br>
Street magnates, and a class of politicians of which Hill was the type.<br>
This view was taken by Bryan. In spite of the opposition of Tammany<br>
leaders and the Hearst faction, twice as many Parker as Hearst delegates<br>
were chosen.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
In the convention, which met at St. Louis, July 9, Judge Parker received<br>
658 votes for President on the first ballot, Hearst received 200, and<br>
there were a few scattering votes. The requisite two-thirds came to<br>
Parker before the result of the ballot was announced. Henry G. Davis, of<br>
West Virginia, was named for the office of Vice-President.<br>
<br>
He had served two terms in the United States Senate, had declined the<br>
office of Post-Master General under President Cleveland, was very<br>
wealthy, and noted for his philanthropy.<br>
<br>
Bryan demanded that the platform should be silent on the question of the<br>
money standard, but Parker declined the nomination unless it should be<br>
understood that he would maintain the gold standard, and his declaration<br>
was endorsed by the convention.<br>
<br>
There were no distinguishing issues between the two leading parties. The<br>
money question had disappeared and both parties were outspoken in their<br>
declarations against trusts and combinations of capital.<br>
<br>
The Populist party, in a convention made up of delegates from one-half<br>
the States, nominated Thomas E. Watson, of Georgia, and Thomas H.<br>
Tubbles, of Nebraska, for President and Vice-President, respectively.<br>
There were two Socialist conventions: one, that of the Social Democratic<br>
party, nominated Eugene V. Debs, of Indiana, for President, and the<br>
Socialist Labor party named Charles H. Corregan, of New York, for the<br>
same office. The nominees of the Prohibitionist party were Silas C.<br>
Swallow, of Pennsylvania, for President, and George W. Carroll, of<br>
Texas, for Vice-President.<br>

The Democratic convention at St. Louis, 1904.<br>
<br>
<br>
The campaign was noteworthy on account of the apathy which was very<br>
general. Heated discussions so characteristic of previous political<br>
contests were seldom heard, and arguments were addressed to the<br>
intelligence of voters rather than to passion and prejudice.<br>
<br>
It has been called a reading rather than a speaking campaign. The<br>
leading Republican document was a pamphlet containing two notable<br>
addresses. One of these was delivered by John Hay at Jackson, Mich., on<br>
the occasion of the celebration of the semi-centennial of the founding<br>
of the Republican party. He attributed to that party the success in the<br>
conduct of public affairs since 1860, and praised President Roosevelt as<br>
a man and great administrator. The other speech was similar in content,<br>
and was delivered by Elihu Root as temporary chairman of the Republican<br>
convention.<br>

<br>
<br>
Toward the close of the campaign, the charge was made that the<br>
Republicans were endeavoring to win through a wholesale purchase of<br>
votes. It was asserted that George B. Cortelyou, manager of the<br>
campaign, having obtained secrets of the conduct of some of the great<br>
corporations, was using that knowledge to force them to contribute to<br>
the Republican fund. A second charge proclaimed that the administration<br>
had changed its attitude toward certain corporations and that the<br>
magnates of Wall Street, having decided to elect Roosevelt, were<br>
contributing generously to the Republican campaign fund. Shortly before<br>
the day for the election, Judge Parker in a series of speeches announced<br>
his belief in these reports. President Roosevelt declared that no proof<br>
for the statements could be produced, and ended as follows: "The<br>
statements made by Mr. Parker are unqualifiedly and atrociously false.<br>
As Mr. Cortelyou has said to me more than once during this campaign, if<br>
elected I shall go into the presidency unhampered by any pledge,<br>
promise, or understanding of any kind, sort or description, save my<br>
promise, made openly to the American people, that so far as in my power<br>
lies I shall see to it that every man has a square deal, no less and no<br>
more." In his reply, Judge Parker reiterated the charge, but gave no<br>
concrete instances of money having been obtained from corporations.<br>

Out of a total vote of 13,544,705, Roosevelt received 7,630,893 votes,<br>
or 2,524,244 more than his leading competitor. His majority was<br>
1,717,081. Debs received 397,308 votes; Swallow, 258,039; Watson,<br>
114,306; Corregan, 32,516. Thirty-three States gave Roosevelt majorities<br>
and twelve Southern States returned majorities for Parker. In the<br>
electoral college Roosevelt received 336 votes and Parker 140. A<br>
surprising feature of the election was the large number of independent<br>
votes cast, as shown by the fact that Minnesota, Massachusetts,<br>
Missouri, and Montana, while giving majorities for the Republican<br>
candidates, elected Democratic governors, and in several other States a<br>
similar tendency was manifest in the divergence between the vote for the<br>
national candidates and local candidates.<br>

AMERICA AND THE CHINESE OPEN DOOR<br>
<br>
[1905]<br>
<br>
The aggressive policy of President Roosevelt continued throughout the<br>
four years succeeding March 4, 1905, when he again took the oath of<br>
office as President. In his suggested reforms he continued to be a real<br>
leader of the people. John Hay, who for seven years had so efficiently<br>
performed his duties as Secretary of State, was continued in that<br>
office. William H. Taft, after his return from the Philippine Islands,<br>
where he had held the office of first civil governor, succeeded Elihu<br>
Root as Secretary of War.<br>
<br>
The United States, having become a world power after the war with Spain,<br>
assumed leadership in the adjustment of Chinese problems. At the close<br>
of the century American manufacturers had built up in China a market for<br>
their cotton goods which they desired to extend. At the same time strife<br>
arose among some of the European nations for trade advantages in that<br>
empire. Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and Italy were demanding<br>
for their citizens concessions, leases, franchises, and special trade<br>
privileges in various parts of that country. Gradually, spheres of<br>
influence covering certain regions were acquired and it seemed probable<br>
that China would be partitioned among the European Powers as Africa had<br>
been in the previous decade. This would be a blow to American export<br>
trade. Now the acquisition of the Philippine Islands gave us a vantage<br>
point from which we could consistently exert influence in Oriental<br>
affairs. In September, 1899, John Hay addressed a note to the European<br>
Powers interested, asking recognition of the policy of the "open door,"<br>
which means that no power should exclude the citizens of other nations<br>
from equal trade rights, within its sphere of influence, in China.<br>
Without winning complete acceptance from all the nations, the justice of<br>
this policy was, in the main, approved.<br>

<br>
<br>
During the following year came the Boxer Rebellion in which there were<br>
massacres of Europeans and Americans. When the foreign legations were<br>
besieged in Peking, United States troops took part in the expedition<br>
which marched to their relief. Seizure of Chinese territory, as<br>
indemnity, might have followed, but Secretary Hay brought the influence<br>
of this country to bear in securing guarantees of the territorial<br>
integrity of China and equal trade rights in its ports.<br>
<br>
Friendly relations between the Chinese Empire and the United States were<br>
still further strengthened by the liberal attitude of our government<br>
relative to the indemnity growing out of the Boxer uprising. The total<br>
amount which China had obligated itself to pay the governments,<br>
societies, and private individuals was $333,000,000. Of this sum,<br>
$24,400,778 was allotted to the United States. As a mark of friendship<br>
for China, Congress upon the recommendation of President Roosevelt,<br>
1907, cancelled the obligation of China to pay that part of the<br>
stipulated indemnity in excess of $11,655,492, or an amount adequate to<br>
cover the actual amount of the claims. This generous conduct prompted<br>
the Chinese government to devote the funds thus remitted to the sending<br>
of Chinese students to this country for their education. About one<br>
hundred of these students have entered our schools and colleges each<br>
year since 1907. American institutions will, as a consequence, have a<br>
great influence on the progressive development of China.<br>
<br>
For some time Russia had been extending her influence over the Chinese<br>
tributary province of Manchuria. In 1903 negotiations for a new<br>
commercial treaty were begun between China and the United States. There<br>
were numerous delays on account of an agreement relative to opening the<br>
Manchurian ports. For a time it seemed probable that the American demand<br>
that her trading rights should be restored in Manchuria would bring on<br>
serious complications with Russia. Upon the completion of the treaty,<br>
however, the request was renewed and China acquiesced by opening the<br>
ports of Mukden and Ta Tung Kao to the ships of all nations. At the same<br>
time Russia agreed that she would in no way oppose this action.<br>

<br>
At the outbreak of the war between Japan and Russia, in 1904, Secretary<br>
Hay took another step toward maintaining the administrative entity of<br>
the Chinese Empire. At the suggestion of Germany he addressed a note to<br>
the powers which had taken part in the treaty of Peking, asking them to<br>
pledge themselves to limit the area of the war; keep China from becoming<br>
involved, and use their best endeavors to prevent the violation of<br>
Chinese interests by either belligerent, provided China should maintain<br>
absolute neutrality. These proposals were agreed to by the signatory<br>
nations, and both Russia and Japan promised to respect Chinese<br>
neutrality.<br>
<br>
Meantime a new national spirit had been developing rapidly in China and<br>
a greater sensitiveness was manifest toward the treatment of Chinese<br>
outside the empire. The strict interpretation of the Chinese Exclusion<br>
act had caused many Chinese entering the ports of the United States<br>
unwarranted hardships. A crisis was reached in 1905.<br>
<br>

<br>
According to the rules adopted by the Secretary of Commerce and Labor,<br>
neither the immigration acts nor the Chinese exclusion acts apply to a<br>
Chinese person born in the United States. Under the laws, all Chinese<br>
laborers, both skilled and unskilled, are prohibited from entering the<br>
United States, but this prohibition does not extend to merchants,<br>
teachers, students, and travellers who are to be granted all the rights,<br>
privileges, and exemptions accorded the citizens of any other nation. In<br>
spite of these rulings, Ju Toy, who claimed to have been born in the<br>
United States, was deported. Three Chinamen, with their sister, who had<br>
been studying in the English schools came to Boston. Notwithstanding<br>
they had a letter from Mr. Choate, former United States ambassador to<br>
Great Britain, they were not allowed to land with other passengers, and<br>
were otherwise humiliated by the formalities to which they were<br>
subjected. Men of influence throughout the Chinese Empire were aroused<br>
and a circular was issued, in May, 1905, which was widely disseminated<br>
in the chief cities, calling for agreement not to buy any more American<br>
goods. Newspapers urged students to leave schools where American<br>
teachers were employed or American text-books or supplies were used. At<br>
this juncture President Roosevelt was appealed to by the American<br>
members of the Chinese Educational Association. Acting with his<br>
accustomed vigor, he issued instructions to the Secretary of Commerce<br>
and Labor to send a letter to all immigration officials, instructing<br>
them that "any discourtesy shown to Chinese persons by any officials of<br>
the Government will be the cause for immediate dismissal from the<br>
service." In his message to Congress he declared that it was Chinese<br>
laborers alone who are undesirable, and that other Chinamen--students,<br>
professional men, merchants--should be encouraged to come to the United<br>
States. "We have no right," he wrote, "to claim the open door in China<br>
unless we do equity to the Chinese."<br>

INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION<br>
<br>
[1903-1905]<br>
<br>
Great progress was made during the nineteenth century toward the<br>
settlement of differences between nations through arbitration. The<br>
United States was a party to 50 out of the total number of 120<br>
arbitration treaties. Questions settled in this manner, such as<br>
boundary, damages inflicted by war or civil disturbances and injuries to<br>
commerce, would formerly have led to war. Twenty of these cases have<br>
been between the United States and Great Britain, and a settlement was<br>
effected when, at times, it seemed as if war could not be averted.<br>
<br>
The work of the Hague Peace Conference, which met May 18, 1899,<br>
constituted a fitting close to the efforts which were put forth during<br>
the century to bring about conciliation through arbitration. The<br>
conference assembled in response to an invitation issued by the Czar of<br>
Russia "on behalf of disarmament and the permanent peace of the world."<br>
One hundred and ten delegates were present, representing twenty-six<br>
different powers of which the United States was one. The delegates were<br>
divided into three commissions, each having separate subjects for<br>
consideration.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 576px; height: 448px;" alt=""
 src="images/095Pic.jpg"><br>
The House in the Woods, The Hague, Holland,<br>
where the first Peace Conference was held.<br>
<br>
<br>
The first commission adopted unanimously the resolution that "the<br>
limitation of the military charges which so oppress the world is<br>
greatly to be desired," but agreed that this&nbsp; could not now be<br>
accomplished through an international compact.<br>
<br>
In the second commission a revision of the Declaration of Brussels<br>
concerning the rules of war was made. It was agreed by the entire<br>
conference that a new convention for this purpose should be called, and<br>
that the protection offered by the Red Cross, as agreed upon in the<br>
Geneva convention, should also be extended to naval warfare.<br>
<br>
The proposition expressing the desire that international conflicts might<br>
in the future be settled through arbitration was considered by the third<br>
commission. Said ex-President Harrison: "The greatest achievement of the<br>
Hague conference was the establishment of an absolutely impartial<br>
judicial tribunal." Some of the chief features of this permanent court<br>
of arbitration were as follows:<br>
(1) Each nation which agreed to the plan was to appoint, within three<br>
months, four persons of recognized competency in international law, who<br>
were to serve for six years as members of the International Court;<br>
(2) an International Bureau was established at The Hague for the purpose<br>
of carrying on all intercourse between the signatory powers relative to<br>
the meetings of the court and to serve also as the recording office, for<br>
the court;<br>
(3) nations in dispute may select from the list of names appointed as<br>
above, and submitted to them by the bureau, those persons whom they<br>
desire to act as arbitrators;<br>
(4) the meetings of the court are to be held at The Hague unless some<br>
other place is stipulated by the nations in the controversy.<br>
<br>
The permanent International Court of Arbitration was declared to be<br>
organized and ready for operation by April, 1901. At that time there<br>
were seventy-two judges appointed by twenty-two of the signatory powers,<br>
It is readily seen that the advantages of such a court are that<br>
unprejudiced arbitrators are selected, rules of procedure are defined,<br>
and decisions rendered are more liable to be accepted in future cases<br>
and thus a code of law will be formed. So many cases have been submitted<br>
to this tribunal that it has been said that a government which will not<br>
now try arbitration before resorting to arms is no longer considered<br>
respectable. This court was convened for the first time May 18, 1901.<br>
<br>
The first case coming before the tribunal--the Pious Fund Case--was<br>
presented by the United States and Mexico, September 15, 1902. Up to<br>
1846 the Mexican government had paid annual interest on some property<br>
administered by it but belonging to the Catholic church. Part of it was<br>
situated in what is now California. After 1848, when this California<br>
estate came under United States jurisdiction, Mexico refused to pay that<br>
part of the church outside of Mexico its share. This difference between<br>
our Government and Mexico the Hague Tribunal took up.<br>
<br>
Agreeably to chapter 3, title 4, of the agreement, each party named two<br>
arbitrators, and the latter, acting together, an umpire. In case of an<br>
equality of votes a third power, designated by agreement of the parties,<br>
was to select the umpire. The arbitrators chosen were M. de Martens, of<br>
the Orthodox Greek church; Sir Edward Fry, an English Protestant; M.<br>
Asser, a Jew, and M. Savornin-Loman, a Dutch Protestant. Decision was<br>
reached within the prescribed thirty days and announced October 14,<br>
1902. It favored the United States contention, giving its proportion of<br>
the Mexican payments to the Catholic church in California.<br>
<br>

President Castro of Venezuela.<br>
<br>
<br>
A second case, involving issues of war and peace, arose from the action<br>
of Great Britain and Germany against Venezuela in the winter of<br>
1902-1903. Subjects of these as well as of&nbsp; other powers had claims<br>
against Venezuela. That country was in financial straits and its<br>
creditors pressed. December 9, 1902, British and German war-ships sunk<br>
or seized some Venezuelan vessels; next day they landed marines at La<br>
Guayra, who took possession of the custom house; the 14th they bombarded<br>
and demolished a fort at Puerto Cabello. Through the good offices of the<br>
United States the matter of debts was referred to the Hague Tribunal.<br>
The German claims were decided by two representatives of Germany and two<br>
of Venezuela, or, if they disagreed, by an umpire whom the United States<br>
selected. So with the other claims. The tribunal fixed the order in<br>
which Venezuela should pay the different countries, and the United<br>
States was charged with overseeing the payments, a percentage of<br>
Venezuelan customs receipts being reserved for that purpose.<br>
<br>
In 1903 Andrew Carnegie donated $1,500,000 for the purpose of erecting a<br>
"palace of peace," the permanent head-quarters of this court. The deed<br>
of trust states: "The establishment of a permanent Court of Arbitration<br>
by the treaty of the 29th of July, 1899, is the most important step<br>
forward, of a world-wide humanitarian character, that has ever been<br>
taken by the joint powers, as it must ultimately banish war, and<br>
further, being of opinion that the cause of peace will greatly benefit<br>
by the erection of a court house and library for the permanent Court of<br>
Arbitration," etc.<br>

The new Peace Palace, The Hague, Holland.<br>
<br>
<br>
The site of this building, which will be ready for occupancy in 1912, is<br>
near The Hague. Its exterior will resemble some of the old city walls to<br>
be seen in Holland. The various governments which were parties to the<br>
treaty have contributed materials for the completion of the interior and<br>
objects of art for decoration. The United States presented a large<br>
marble group of statuary called "Peace Through Justice."<br>
<br>
Two notable congresses were held in the United States during the year<br>
1904, for the purpose of promoting the peace of the world. The<br>
Inter-Parliamentary Union held a meeting, the twelfth in its history, in<br>
connection with the World's Fair at St. Louis. This organization was<br>
founded at Paris in 1888 by thirty members of the French Chamber of<br>
Deputies and ten members of the British Parliament, for the purpose of<br>
promoting the cause of peace and arbitration. Scoffed at from the<br>
beginning, the Union continued to grow until it included parliamentary<br>
delegates from every European country having a constitutional form of<br>
government.<br>
<br>
The meeting of the Union at St. Louis was the first to be held in the<br>
United States, for this country took no part in the organization until<br>
1903. Russia and Turkey, having no parliaments, are not represented in<br>
the meetings of the Union. It is a noteworthy fact however that the Czar<br>
sent an official representative to the meeting in 1896 and that it was<br>
due to his report of that meeting, more than to any other cause, that<br>
the Czar invited the nations to send representatives to The Hague in<br>
1898.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
In the congress at St. Louis, representatives from the deliberative<br>
bodies of fifteen nations were present. Among these delegates were some<br>
of the well-known public men from Great Britain, France, Germany,<br>
Austria, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands, the United States, and various<br>
other countries. They were practical men and not dreamers.<br>
<br>
Two important resolutions resulted from the gathering. One of these<br>
called upon the powers to intervene and put an end to the war between<br>
Russia and Japan. The other invited the President of the United States<br>
to call a second peace congress, similar to the Hague conference. The<br>
resolution, addressed to President Roosevelt, stated that there were a<br>
number of questions left unsettled from the first Hague conference and<br>
that new problems had arisen since that time which demanded<br>
readjustment, such as the use of wireless telegraphy in the time of war.<br>
<br>
On October 3 of the same year an international peace congress was held<br>
in Boston. Numerous congresses of this nature have been held from time<br>
to time since the meeting of the first one in London in 1843. Since the<br>
year 1888, when a congress was held in Paris, an international peace<br>
congress has met each year with the exception of 1895, the year of the<br>
Boer war, and in 1898 and 1899, on account of the Spanish-American war.<br>
The first of these congresses in America was held in conjunction with<br>
the Columbian Exposition at Chicago, 1893. There were in attendance at<br>
Boston distinguished statesmen, clergymen, scholars, and professional<br>
men, and a number of noted women, representing the many peace and<br>
arbitration societies in Great Britain, Germany, Austria, and numerous<br>
other countries.<br>
<br>
On the Sunday before the opening of the congress, special services were<br>
held in many of the Boston churches and the peace movement was discussed<br>
by distinguished preachers from Europe and America. In the deliberative<br>
sessions, which were held in Faneuil Hall, the Old South Meeting House,<br>
and other places, the first session being opened by an address by<br>
Secretary of State John Hay, the following topics, among others, were<br>
discussed: the work and influence of the Hague Tribunal; the reduction<br>
of the armaments of the nations; education and the peace sentiment. But<br>
here, as in every previous congress, the two topics to receive primary<br>
consideration have been arbitration and disarmament. At all times there<br>
has been the urgent appeal to the nations to abandon the brutality and<br>
injustice of war and to adopt the humane and just methods of peace.<br>
<br>
In response to the resolution adopted at St. Louis, President Roosevelt,<br>
on October 20, 1904, invited the nations which had taken part in the<br>
first Hague conference to another conference at the same place. But in<br>
his message to Congress of that year he defined very clearly his own<br>
position, condemning in no uncertain terms the thought of peace at any<br>
price. "There are kinds of peace," he said, "which are highly<br>
undesirable, which are in the long run as destructive as any war. The<br>
peace of tyrannous terror, the peace of craven weakness, the peace of<br>
injustice--all these should be shunned as we shun unrighteous war."<br>

was held, The Hague, Holland.<br>

Favorable replies to the invitation sent by President Roosevelt were<br>
received from all the nations. Russia, then in the midst of war with<br>
Japan, while approving, stipulated that the conference should not be<br>
called until the end of that war. When peace was restored, in the summer<br>
of 1905, Emperor Nicholas II issued an invitation to fifty-three nations<br>
to send representatives to such a conference. For the first time, nearly<br>
every independent nation on the globe was represented among the<br>
delegates in an international gathering of this nature. It met at The<br>
Hague during the summer of 1907.<br>

First session of the second Peace Conference, The Hague, Holland.<br>
<br>
<br>
Delegates from the United States were instructed to favor obligatory<br>
arbitration; the establishment of a permanent court of arbitration; the<br>
prohibition of force in the collection of contract debts; immunity from<br>
seizure of private property at sea; a clearer definition of the rights<br>
of neutrals, and the limitation of armaments.<br>
<br>
While belief was reasserted by the conference that there should be the<br>
obligatory arbitration of all questions relating to treaties and<br>
international problems of a legal nature, the principle was not adopted,<br>
although thirty-two nations of the forty-five represented favored it.<br>
<br>
The resolution adopted, which provided for the collection of contract<br>
debts, is as follows: "In order to avoid between nations armed conflicts<br>
of a purely pecuniary origin arising from contractual debts claimed of<br>
the government of one country by the government of another country to be<br>
due to its nationals, the signatory powers agree not to have recourse to<br>
armed force for the collection of such contractual debts. However, this<br>
stipulation shall not be applicable when the debtor State refuses or<br>
leaves unanswered an offer to arbitrate; or, in case of acceptance,<br>
makes it impossible to formulate the terms of submission; or, after<br>
arbitration, fails to comply with the award rendered."<br>
<br>
Provision was made for an international prize court, to which appeal<br>
might be made from the prize courts of the belligerent powers. The<br>
declaration was adopted prohibiting the throwing of projectiles and<br>
explosives from balloons.<br>
<br>
Before the end of the year 1908, one hundred and thirty-five arbitration<br>
treaties had been concluded. The United States was a party to twelve of<br>
these. Most of the treaties bind the signatory powers to submit to the<br>
Hague Tribunal all differences in so far as they do not affect "the<br>
independence, the honor, the vital interests, or the exercise of<br>
sovereignty of the contracting countries, and provided it has been<br>
impossible to obtain an amicable solution by means of direct diplomatic<br>
negotiations or by any other method of conciliation."<br>

THE UNITED STATES AND LATIN AMERICA<br>
<br>
[1905-1906]<br>
<br>
Looking toward the completion of the Panama Canal, there has been a<br>
revival of interest on the part of the United States in the republics of<br>
South America. From the time of the promulgation of the Monroe Doctrine,<br>
there has been a distant friendship on our part for these nations. The<br>
plan inaugurated by James G. Blaine when Secretary of State is much<br>
better understood to-day than in his time. In 1881, with the desire of<br>
emphasizing the leadership of the United States in the western<br>
hemisphere, he proposed a congress of all the American nations. Nothing<br>
came of the proposal at the time, but in 1888 Congress passed a<br>
resolution providing for such an international conference. The meeting<br>
was in Washington the following year, and Secretary Blaine, as chairman,<br>
exercised great influence. While the direct results of the meeting were<br>
not great--principally a declaration in favor of the arbitration of all<br>

In the meantime the trade with these countries has been largely<br>
monopolized by England, France, and Germany. During the year 1905, the<br>
total exports and imports of the Latin-American countries amounted to<br>
$2,000,000,000. Of this foreign trade the United States bought 35 per<br>
cent of the exports and sold to these countries only 27 per cent of<br>
their imports, producing an unfavorable balance of trade amounting to<br>
$200,000,000. Of the goods imported from this country, over one-fourth<br>
went to Mexico and Cuba. In that year Brazil bought from the United<br>
States only 11 per cent of its imports. Argentina, with a larger foreign<br>
trade than either Japan or China, bought only 14 per cent of its imports<br>
from the United States. With the exception of Mexico, the foreign<br>
commerce of the Latin-American states with European countries has<br>
increased more rapidly than with the United States. Various reasons have<br>
been given for this situation. The sensitive South American resents the<br>
air of superiority assumed toward them by the people of the United<br>
States. In our newspapers there is a seeming disregard for the real<br>
evidences of their national development. Revolutions and boundary<br>
disputes have been exaggerated. In general, citizens of the United<br>
States have no comprehension of the advancement of these countries<br>
within recent times and appreciate but slightly that their economic<br>
future is as fully assured as our own. Argentina constitutes an<br>
excellent example of this progress. This country has an area of<br>
1,135,840 square miles. Splendid rivers water the immense plains. The<br>
chief of these, the Parana, which flows 2,000 miles through the country,<br>
carries a volume of water to the sea one and one-half times that of the<br>
Mississippi, and is capable of floating ships having a draught of 18<br>
feet for 600 miles into the interior. Buenos Ayres, with a population of<br>
1,000,000, in 1906 had a volume of foreign trade amounting to<br>
$562,000,000, constituting it the twelfth port in the world. In 1905<br>
over 10,000,000 acres of land were cultivated in Argentina, an increase<br>
of fourfold within fifteen years. The cereals, cotton, fruits, and meats<br>
produced amounted to $350,000,000.<br>
<br>
That the volume of trade between this country and the South American<br>
states has been so small has been due also to the fact that so few<br>
vessels flying the stars and stripes are engaged in this trade.<br>
According to the report of Secretary Root, in 1906, there were in the<br>
harbor of Rio Janeiro the previous year, 1,785 ships flying the flag of<br>
Great Britain; 657 the flag of Germany; 349 the French; 142 the<br>
Norwegian, and 7 sailing vessels (two of them in distress) the flag of<br>
the United States. The bulk of goods from this country to South America<br>
goes by the way of European ports and on foreign ships.<br>

Conference was held in Rio de Janeiro.<br>
<br>
<br>
July 4, 1906, the third Pan-American conference was opened at Rio<br>
Janeiro. Among the leading questions discussed were: (1) the right of<br>
creditor nations to enforce by war on the debtor nations contractual<br>
obligations, or the right to use gun-boats as collection agents; and (2)<br>
those relating to commercial intercourse. Besides the regular delegates<br>
from the United States, Elihu Root, Secretary of State, was present at<br>
the opening session. His address at this meeting, together with his<br>
visit to the leading cities, served to inaugurate a new understanding<br>
between these countries and the United States. The true American policy<br>
was set forth by Secretary Root in the following toast: "May the<br>
independence, the freedom, and the rights of the least and weakest be<br>
ever respected equally with the rights of the strongest, and may we all<br>
do our share toward the building up of a sound and enlightened public<br>
opinion of the Americas which shall everywhere, upon both continents,<br>
mightily promote the reign of peace, of order, and of justice in every<br>
American republic." He went as Ambassador Extraordinary representing the<br>
President of the United States. In order to emphasize his official<br>
position, he travelled on an American war-ship. His addresses made in<br>
the various cities were intended to be an official declaration from the<br>
government of the United States, and that position was outlined in his<br>
formal address before the congress. "We wish for no victories," he said,<br>
"but those of peace; for no territory except our own; for no sovereignty<br>
except the sovereignty over ourselves. We deem the independence and<br>
equal rights of the smallest and weakest member of the family of nations<br>
entitled to as much respect as those of the greatest empire, and we deem<br>
the observance of that respect the chief guaranty of the weak against<br>
the oppression of the strong. We neither claim nor desire any rights or<br>
privileges or powers that we do not freely concede to every American<br>
republic. We wish to increase our prosperity, to expand our trade, to<br>
grow in wealth, in wisdom, and in spirit, but our conception of the true<br>
way to accomplish this is not to pull down others and profit by their<br>
ruin, but to help all friends to a common prosperity and a common<br>
growth, that we may all become greater and stronger together."<br>

<br>
The International Bureau of American Republics was founded as a result<br>
of the first Pan-American conference. The original plans of the<br>
founders were not carried out owing to a lack of interest on the part of<br>
the Department of State as well as in the foreign offices of the South<br>
American countries. Secretary Root determined to make this bureau an<br>
efficient agency for bringing about better relations between the two<br>
continents. He defined the main purpose to be not only to build up trade<br>
and commerce among all American nations, but to promote more friendly<br>
relations, a better understanding of each other, and the general<br>
prosperity and well-being of all the countries of the American<br>
continents. Through gifts from Andrew Carnegie and contributions from<br>
the different South American states a splendid modern building, costing<br>
$1,000,000, was erected in Washington, 1908, as the home of the Bureau<br>
of the Pan-American Republics. Besides other enterprises, the Bureau<br>
publishes a monthly periodical which contains information on the<br>
commerce, new enterprises, and general development of each republic.<br>

<br>
With these new relationships came a new interpretation of the Monroe<br>
Doctrine. At various times European nations have engaged in<br>
controversies with South American states over the payment of debts due<br>
the citizens of the former. The question has then arisen, to what extent<br>
shall the United States permit the use of force against the debtor<br>
nations? The wider application of the Monroe Doctrine under President<br>
Cleveland looking toward the maintenance of the rights of the weaker<br>
American nations, has been followed by recognition of our obligation to<br>
secure the performance of duties by those nations. Said President<br>
Roosevelt (1905): "We cannot permanently adhere to the Monroe Doctrine<br>
unless we succeed in making it evident, in the first place, that we do<br>
not intend to treat it in any shape or way as an excuse for<br>
aggrandizement on our part at the expense of the republics to the south<br>
of us; second, that we do not intend to permit it to be used by any of<br>
these republics as a shield to protect that republic from the<br>
consequences of its own misdeeds against foreign nations; third, that<br>
inasmuch as by this doctrine we prevent other nations from interfering<br>
on this side of the water, we shall ourselves in good faith try to help<br>
those of our sister republics, which need such help, upward toward peace<br>
and order."<br>
<br>
The immediate cause for this statement by President Roosevelt was the<br>
problem confronting our government on account of the bankrupt condition<br>
of the Republic of Santo Domingo. Debts had accumulated for over thirty<br>
years until by the beginning of 1905 they amounted to more than<br>
$32,000,000. Each successive ruler became a more reckless borrower and<br>
new loans were secured upon harsher terms.<br>
<br>
Finally affairs were brought to a crisis on account of the pressure on<br>
the part of the French and Italian governments for the payment of the<br>
claims of their citizens. The republic was on the verge of dissolution<br>
when President Roosevelt intervened. European governments were<br>
satisfied, for it signified the payment of their claims. An agreement<br>
was signed by representatives of the government of Santo Domingo and of<br>
the United States whereby the United States was to undertake the task of<br>
collecting and apportioning the revenues of Santo Domingo. The<br>
stipulation was made that no plan of annexation, purchase, or permanent<br>
control on the part of the United States should ensue. Agents were to be<br>
appointed by the United States who should take charge of the<br>
customhouses. Forty-five per cent of the total receipts were to be used<br>
in carrying on the affairs of the republic and the balance was to go to<br>
pay the indebtedness. In his message, February, 1905, President<br>
Roosevelt, pressing upon the Senate the urgent need for the ratification<br>
of this agreement, said: "The state of things in Santo Domingo has<br>
become hopeless unless the United States or some other strong government<br>
shall interpose to bring order out of chaos. . . . If the United States<br>
declines to take action and other foreign governments resort to action<br>
to secure payment of their claims, the latter would be entitled,<br>
according to the decision of the Hague Tribunal in the Venezuela cases,<br>
to the preferential payment of their claims; and this would absorb all<br>
the Dominican revenues and would be a virtual sacrifice of American<br>
claims and interests in the island. If, moreover, any such action should<br>
be taken by them, the only method to enable the payment of their claims<br>
would be to take possession of the custom-houses, and, considering the<br>
state of the Dominican finances, this would mean a definite and very<br>
possibly permanent occupation of Dominican territory, for no period<br>
could be set to the time which would be necessarily required for the<br>
payment of their obligations and unliquidated claims." The Senate, in<br>
special session, shirked responsibility and refused either to ratify or<br>
reject the treaty.<br>
<br>
With the revolutionists on the island growing stronger and the European<br>
Powers becoming more insistent, President Roosevelt, disregarding the<br>
attitude of the Senate, appointed an American as receiver of customs.<br>
The move proved immediately successful. The insurrection died out, trade<br>
revived, smuggling ceased, and the people were infused with a new<br>
spirit. There was also a remarkable increase in the customs receipts,<br>
those of 1906 showing an increase of 44 per cent over the receipts of<br>
1905 and 72 per cent over those of 1904. Although only 45 per cent of<br>
the revenues collected were turned over to the Dominican government,<br>
this sum was almost double the amount which they had received when they<br>
had control of the collection themselves.<br>
<br>
After two years of discussion, the treaty was ratified by the Senate,<br>
February 25, 1907, and by the Dominican Congress, May 3. The terms were<br>
practically those which had been carried out by order of President<br>
Roosevelt. The United States, in a sense, became the trustee of Santo<br>
Domingo, and thus established a new relation between this country and<br>
the smaller republics of the western hemisphere.<br>

CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES<br>
<br>
[1906]<br>
<br>
Toward the close of the nineteenth century, attention was called to the<br>
fact by scientific men that the methods employed in the use of our soil,<br>
mines, forests, and water supply were extremely wasteful. During the<br>
previous decades the resources of the country were regarded as<br>
inexhaustible. As stated by President Roosevelt in 1907: "Hitherto as a<br>
nation we have tended to live with an eye single to the present, and<br>
have permitted the reckless waste and destruction of much of our<br>
national wealth." At the same time the call came for the conservation of<br>
our natural resources.<br>
<br>
The destruction of the forests first attracted attention. The first<br>
national reservation of forests was made in 1891, and in 1898 a marked<br>
advance was made by the establishment of a division of Forestry in the<br>
Department of Agriculture. Gifford Pinchot, as chief of the division,<br>
called attention of the people to the interdependence of the forests and<br>
the waterways.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
In 1906, after long effort, the famous Mariposa Grove of large trees in<br>
California was made a national reservation. During the same year a bill<br>
was passed by Congress providing for the preservation of Niagara Falls.<br>
Public opinion had been aroused by the campaign of the American Civic<br>
Association. Power companies had multiplied so rapidly that it seemed<br>
the whole volume of water was about to be used for commercial purposes<br>
and that the most famous object of natural scenery in the United States<br>
would be destroyed.<br>
<br>
In response to appeals from the people of the interior, President<br>
Roosevelt, March 14, 1907, appointed the Inland Waterways Commission. In<br>
his letter which created the commission he said: "The time has come for<br>
merging local projects and uses of the inland waters in a comprehensive<br>
plan designed for the benefit of the entire country. . . . I ask that<br>
the Inland Waterways Commission shall consider the relations of the<br>
streams to the use of all the great permanent natural resources and<br>
their conservation for the making and maintenance of prosperous homes."<br>
<br>
This commission while carrying on its investigations discussed the<br>
general policy of conservation and suggested to the President the<br>
calling of a convention for the purpose of discussing the conservation<br>
of the nation's resources. Thus originated the celebrated White House<br>
conference of May 13-15, 1908. The opening session presented an<br>
impressive scene, for there were assembled in the east room of the White<br>
House, upon the invitation of the President, the Vice-President, seven<br>
members of the cabinet, all of the justices of the Supreme Court, most<br>
of the representatives and senators, thirty-four governors of States<br>
together with their advisers, and representatives of the governors of<br>
the remaining States, governors of the Territories, representatives of<br>
sixty-eight national societies, and numerous special guests.<br>
<br>
The opening address of President Roosevelt was a notable effort. "This<br>
conference," he said, "on the conservation of natural resources is in<br>
effect a meeting of the representatives of all the people of the United<br>
States called to consider the weightiest problem now before the nation.<br>
. . . We have become great in a material sense because of the lavish use<br>
of our resources, and we have just reason to be proud of our growth. But<br>
the time has come to inquire seriously what will happen when our forests<br>
are gone; when the coal, the iron, the oil, and the gas are exhausted;<br>
when the soils shall have been still further impoverished and washed<br>
into the streams, polluting the rivers, denuding the fields, and<br>
obstructing navigation. These questions do not relate only to the next<br>
century or the next generation. One distinguishing characteristic of<br>
really civilized men is foresight; we have to, as a nation, exercise<br>
foresight for this nation in the future, and if we do not exercise that<br>
foresight, dark will be the future!"<br>
<br>
During the meeting numerous addresses were made on the conservation of<br>
the minerals, of the soils, of the forests, and of the waters of the<br>
country. In his address on the conservation of ores and related<br>
minerals, Andrew Carnegie declared that during the three-fourths of a<br>
century from 1820 to 1895 nearly 4,000,000,000 tons of coal were mined<br>
by methods so wasteful that 6,000,000,000 tons were either destroyed or<br>
allowed to remain in the ground forever inaccessible. From 1896 to 1906<br>
as much coal was produced as during the preceding seventy-five years.<br>
During this decade 3,000,000,000 tons were destroyed or left in the<br>
ground beyond reach for future use. Basing his statements on the<br>
investigations of scientists, he showed that at the present rate of<br>
increase in production the available coal of the country would be<br>
exhausted in two hundred years and the workable iron ore within a<br>
century.<br>

<br>
Similarly, James J. Hill demonstrated that the forests of this country<br>
are fast disappearing and that from three to four times as much timber<br>
was consumed each year as forest growth restored. His statements<br>
regarding the tremendous soil waste in our farming methods were likewise<br>
astounding. Resolutions were adopted covering the entire subject of<br>
conservation as shown in one of them as follows: "We agree that the land<br>
should be so used that erosion and soil-wash shall cease; that there<br>
should be reclamation of arid and semi-arid regions by means of<br>
irrigation, and of swamps and overflowed regions by means of drainage;<br>
that the waters should be so conserved and used as to promote<br>
navigation, to enable the arid regions to be reclaimed by irrigation,<br>
and to develop power in the interests of the people; that the forests<br>
which regulate our rivers, support our industries, and promote the<br>
fertility and productiveness of the soil should be preserved and<br>
perpetuated; that the minerals found so abundantly beneath the surface<br>
should be so used as to prolong their utility; that the beauty,<br>
healthfulness, and habitability of our country should be preserved and<br>
increased; that the sources of national wealth exist for the benefit of<br>
the people, and that monopoly thereof should not be tolerated." It was<br>
recommended that the States should establish conservation commissions to<br>
co-operate with one another and with a similar national commission.<br>
<br>
On June 8, 1908, the first national conservation commission was created<br>
by President Roosevelt. Its forty-nine members were men well known in<br>
politics, in the industries, and scientific work. Gifford Pinchot was<br>
chairman of this commission which submitted its first report at a<br>
conference in Washington, December 8-10, 1908. The delegates consisted<br>
of governors and other representatives from the States and from national<br>
organizations. This report was received with favor and it was<br>
recommended that the work of the commission should be continued.<br>
Congress declined to make the necessary appropriation of $25,000 for<br>
this purpose, although it was strongly endorsed by the President.<br>
<br>
In 1901 the National Conservation Association was formed, a voluntary<br>
organization of public and scientific men. The purpose of this<br>
association is to carry on the movement for conservation in every State.<br>
Within seven months after the White House conference, forty-one State<br>
conservation commissions were created and fifty-one conservation<br>
commissions representing national organizations were formed.<br>
<br>
President Roosevelt carried the movement still farther in calling the<br>
first North American conservation congress. Representatives to this<br>
conference met in Washington, February 18, 1909. They came from Canada,<br>
Newfoundland, and Mexico as well as the United States. Broad general<br>
principles of conservation applicable to the North American continent<br>
were adopted.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The movement was materially strengthened also through the withdrawal of<br>
large areas of the public domain from private entry. Thus 148,000,000<br>
acres of forests and 80,000,000 acres of coal land were withdrawn during<br>
President Roosevelt's administrations.<br>
<br>
Directly connected with the problems of conservation are those of<br>
irrigation. The so-called arid regions constitute two-fifths of the<br>
area of the United States, or some 1,200,000 square miles. Of this vast<br>
region, it has been estimated that about one-tenth can be irrigated to<br>
advantage. By the end of the year 1908, some 13,000,000 acres had been<br>
reclaimed, or nearly one-third of the total amount suitable for<br>
irrigation purposes. This has brought about the rapid growth of cities<br>
and a substantial industrial advance in the former arid regions of the<br>
far West. The most notable impulse to this movement was made in 1902<br>
when Congress passed a law, the Reclamation act, providing that the<br>
proceeds from the sales of public lands in thirteen States and three<br>
Territories should be expended by the National Government in the<br>
construction of irrigation works.<br>
<br>
The total receipts from the sales of these lands amounted to $28,000,000<br>
by the end of the year 1905, and twenty-three projects, dams,<br>
reservoirs, or canals were in different stages of construction. The most<br>
important of these undertakings were the Roosevelt Dam, the Shoshone<br>
Dam, and the Truckee-Carson Canal.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The Roosevelt Dam is the chief work of construction in what is called<br>
the Salt River project. By the completion of this work at least 200,000<br>
acres in the vicinity of Phoenix, Arizona, were reclaimed. This dam is<br>
284 feet high, 1,080 feet long on the crest, and 165 feet thick at the<br>
base. The resulting reservoir with a storage area of 16,320 acres will<br>
be the largest artificially formed lake in the world.&nbsp; It forms a
body<br>
of water 25 miles long, almost 2 miles broad, and with a maximum depth<br>
of 220 feet. The main canals are 119 miles in length and the lateral<br>
canals 208 miles. Not only will this structure insure a supply of water<br>
in the Salt River valley where, in recent years, orchards and other<br>
products have perished, but it will prevent the floods which have<br>
devastated that region from time to time. Water-power amounting to<br>
25,000 horse-power has been developed by the construction. This power<br>
is used in part for pumping, and another area, estimated at 40,000<br>
acres, outside the territory covered by the canals has been reclaimed.<br>
The power is also used for lighting, for manufacturing, and for mining.<br>
<br>
It was seen that the Shoshone River, in northwestern Wyoming, during the<br>
season of melting snows, carried away more waste water than would be<br>
adequate to reclaim many thousands of acres in the arid regions of the<br>
lower altitudes. Two million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars were<br>
allotted for the construction of the Shoshone Dam which will form a<br>
reservoir of water sufficient to irrigate 75,000 acres of land 50 miles<br>
farther down the river.<br>
<br>

<br>
The Truckee-Carson project provides for the irrigation of 150,000 acres<br>
in western Nevada. The water of the Truckee River, which flows out of<br>
Lake Tahoe, is distributed by canals having an aggregate length of 670<br>
miles. The main canal was opened in 1905.<br>
<br>
By the close of the year 1906, over $39,000,000 had been allotted for<br>
works under actual construction, and this amount had increased to<br>
$119,500,000 within four years. It has been estimated that the land thus<br>
reclaimed will alone be worth $240,000,000. The additional cost of a<br>
project is assessed against the land. When the land is sold, the money<br>
received is used for the development of new irrigation areas.<br>
<br>
Another significant plan outlined by the irrigation congress in its<br>
meeting, 1911, provided for bringing about the complete reclamation of<br>
all swamp and overflowed land. The swampland area of the United States<br>
exceeds 74,500,000 acres, or an amount greater than the area of the<br>
Philippine Islands by 1,000,000 acres.<br>
<br>
The Mississippi basin has been called the heart and soul of the<br>
prosperity of the United States. Two-fifths of the area of the country,<br>
comprising one-half the population, is tributary to the Mississippi<br>
system, which has over 20,000 miles of navigable waters. This valley<br>
produces three-fourths of our foreign exports. The network of railroads<br>
covering this territory has for a number of years furnished altogether<br>
inadequate transportation facilities, and conditions have grown steadily<br>
worse. Traffic experts throughout the United States have been advising<br>
river improvement as a means of relieving the congestion of freight.<br>
This situation has led to a revival of interest in the deep waterway<br>
from the Lakes to the Gulf which has been talked and written about for<br>
nearly three-quarters of a century.<br>

Concerted action was not taken until 1907, when the Lakes to the Gulf<br>
Deep Waterways Association was formed at St. Louis, having for its<br>
object the deepening of the water-way between Lake Michigan and the<br>
Gulf. The proposal to construct a canal by the way of the Illinois River<br>
to the Mississippi, large enough to carry ships, was declared feasible<br>
by government engineers and a route was surveyed. President Roosevelt<br>
endorsed the scheme. In his message to Congress, December 3, 1907, he<br>
said: "From the Great Lakes to the mouth of the Mississippi there should<br>
be a deep water-way, with deep water-ways leading from it to the East<br>
and the West. Such a water-way would practically mean the extension of<br>
our coast line into the very heart of our country. It would be of<br>
incalculable benefit to our people. If begun at once it can be carried<br>
through in time appreciably to relieve the congestion of our great<br>
freight-carrying lines of railroad. The work should be systematically<br>
and continuously carried forward in accordance with some well-conceived<br>
plan . . . . Moreover, the development of our water-ways involves many<br>
other important water problems, all of which should be considered as<br>
part of the same general scheme."<br>
<br>
He appointed an Inland Waterways Commission which was to outline a<br>
comprehensive scheme of development along the various lines indicated.<br>
Their leading recommendation had to do with the proposal for a deep<br>
water-way from Chicago to New Orleans. The completion of the drainage<br>
canal by the city of Chicago, at a cost of $55,000,000, really created a<br>
deep waterway for forty miles along the intended route. It was reported<br>
to Congress by a special board of surveyors that the continuation of<br>
such a water-way to St. Louis would cost $31,000,000.<br>
<br>

Inland Waterways Commission.<br>
<br>
<br>
The legislature of Illinois, following the recommendation of Governor<br>
Charles S. Deneen, submitted to the people an amendment of the<br>
constitution which would enable the State to assume a bonded<br>
indebtedness of $20,000,000 for the purpose of constructing a deep<br>
waterway from Chicago to St. Louis. The measure was approved by popular<br>
vote November 3, 1907. Thereupon, the State Senate passed a bill<br>
providing for the construction of the canal. This failed in the House.<br>
It was again introduced into the legislature, 1910, but failed to pass.<br>
<br>
Among the other important projects submitted by the Inland Waterways<br>
Commission are the following: To connect the Great Lakes with the ocean<br>
by a twenty-foot channel by the way of the Erie Canal and the Hudson<br>
River, an inner channel extending from New England to Florida; to<br>
connect the Columbia River with Puget Sound and deepen the Sacramento<br>
and the San Joaquin Rivers, so as to bring commerce by water to<br>
Sacramento and other interior California cities.<br>
<br>
With the hope that New York City might again come into a mastery of the<br>
trade with the West, as at the time when the Erie Canal was first<br>
completed and because of the inability of the railroads to meet the<br>
demands of traffic, the legislature of New York, in 1903, appropriated<br>
$100,000,000 for the enlargement of that waterway and the two branch<br>
canals, the Oswego and Champlain. The proposed uniform depth is twelve<br>
feet and it is otherwise to be large enough for boats of a thousand ton<br>
cargo or four times the capacity of boats now on the canal.<br>

DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW SOUTH<br>
<br>
[1904]<br>
<br>
The term New South signifies the transition which has taken place<br>
through energy applied to the opportunities which that section of the<br>
United States offers. The South has natural gifts which in themselves<br>
will make it a marvel of wealth. The coast line measures 3,000 miles and<br>
already the ports of New Orleans and Galveston are among the most<br>
important on our seaboard. In 1898 the imports along the Gulf amounted<br>
to $13,000,000, and in 1908 they amounted to $59,350,000. In 1898 the<br>
exports were valued at $202,000,000; in 1908 they were valued at nearly<br>
$400,000,000. The completion of the Panama Canal will certainly increase<br>
the importance of the Southern seaboard cities.<br>

<br>
<br>
There are in the United States navigable streams amounting to 26,410<br>
miles and of these the South has 18,215 miles. Mr. Wilson, Secretary of<br>
Agriculture, has estimated that the waterpower facilities of the South<br>
equal 5,000,000 horse-power for the six high-water months--five times<br>
the amount New England has. By a system of reservoirs this supply could<br>
be doubled. Roughly speaking, the country can be divided into three<br>
water-power districts: (1) the wholly undeveloped district which lies<br>
about Birmingham, Alabama, the centre of the great iron and coal<br>
district of the South; (2) a well-exploited district along the<br>
Chattahoochee, extending from Atlanta to Columbus, Georgia; (3) a<br>
district which lies in the favored agricultural region of northern South<br>
Carolina and southern North Carolina. Here about one-third of the easily<br>
available power has been developed. To-day New England, poor in raw<br>
materials and having an area of only 66,000 square miles, manufactures<br>
as much as does the whole South which is rich in raw materials and has<br>
an area of 1,000,000 square miles. It is hardly necessary to make<br>
forecasts--possibly it is wiser to ask what can possibly hinder the<br>
development of this favored section.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
In minerals and forests the South is equally rich. The coal supply,<br>
according to the report of the National Conservation Commission, amounts<br>
to 611,748,000,000 tons and the riches in iron in the southern<br>
Appalachian district are equally enormous. Forty-one per cent of the<br>
remaining forest area is in the same country. Unless a system of<br>
conservation is put into operation, however, these vast timber resources<br>
will pass away, for the forests are being used at a rate of more than<br>
three and one-half times the annual growth. Private interests own<br>
125,000,000 acres in the South and practically none of the timber is<br>
being handled with the idea of conservation. There are no "State<br>
forests"; neither are there adequate laws for the prevention of forest<br>
fires.<br>
<br>
The economic advancement of the South during the past thirty years has<br>
been wonderful. The tide of migration within our country no longer moves<br>
Westward as much as Southward and in its wake has followed a flood of<br>
capital. The increase of population and capital is necessary to the<br>
industrial growth of the South, and in spite of the recent influx the<br>
scarcity of laborers remains a serious problem, the solution of which is<br>
absolutely necessary for the development of the manufacturing industries<br>
as well as agriculture. Immigrants of good standing are constantly<br>
sought by the States, and to cope with the problem some individuals have<br>
been guilty of operating a system of peonage. Lack of efficiency in the<br>
laborers makes the problem still more perplexing. Scientific<br>
investigations conducted with the aim of discovering the causes for this<br>
general inefficiency have led to the conclusion that the eradication of<br>
the mosquito and hook-worm will add greatly to the ability of the<br>
wage-earners. A systematic campaign in this direction has been made<br>
possible through the recent gift of Mr. Rockefeller.<br>
<br>

A field of cotton.<br>
<br>
<br>
The South has always been largely an agricultural section, with the<br>
production of cotton as the leading interest. In 1909 the yield was<br>
about 13,500,000 bales from about 32,000,000 acres. In value the crop<br>
equals about twice the annual output of all the gold mines in the world.<br>
The 8,000,000 bales which are exported annually represent an income to<br>
the United States of about $400,000,000. The problem which has called<br>
for the most attention is that the average output per acre has been<br>
decreasing for years. During the past few years the white farmers have<br>
taken active steps to remedy this weakness. Agricultural experiment<br>
stations have conducted investigations and the agricultural press has<br>
interpreted these results to the actual farmers and has conducted a<br>
systematic agitation for an agricultural revolution. Associations have<br>
been formed for the purpose of studying conditions and introducing<br>
improved methods in preparing the soil and rotating crops. More of the<br>
food supply of the South is to be raised at home; better homes and farm<br>
buildings are being erected, and better machinery is being used. The<br>
invention of a mechanical cotton picker, which has been accomplished,<br>
should reduce materially the cost of handling the crop.<br>
<br>

Bales of cotton ready for shipment.<br>

<br>
<br>
Closely connected with this is the problem of roads. Where railroads are<br>
scarce good wagon roads are all the more necessary. In the South<br>
(excluding Kentucky, Arkansas, and Oklahoma) there are 500,000 miles of<br>
public roads serving a population of over 20,000,000 people. In 1908<br>
there were only 17,700 miles of improved road. To help along this work<br>
good roads associations have been formed in the various States.<br>
<br>
The old methods of financing the plantation system are passing. The<br>
planters are breaking away from the credit system which has kept them as<br>
borrowers and debtors and, as a result, they have money for investments<br>
elsewhere. The great problems connected with cotton culture are the<br>
labor supply and proper conservation of the soil. These solved, the<br>
friends of the South confidently believe that thirty times as much<br>
cotton could be produced as is produced at present. When one learns that<br>
only 145,200,000 acres out of 612,000,000 are now under cultivation, the<br>
claim does not seem extravagant.<br>

Loading cotton on the levee, New Orleans.<br>
<br>
Southern farmers have learned that other products besides cotton pay<br>
well. Less than twenty years ago practically no hay was raised for sale<br>
in the Gulf States. The red clover and timothy which the planter thought<br>
could only be raised in the North are now cultivated in the South. Iowa,<br>
the greatest hay-growing State in the Union, has for the past ten years<br>
averaged 1.58 tons per acre at an average value of $5.45 per ton.<br>
Mississippi during the same time has averaged 1.62 tons to the acre<br>
valued at over $10 a ton. Alfalfa has been found to be excellent feed<br>
for stock and the yield, which averages from four to eight tons per<br>
acre, sells for from $10 to $18 a ton. Corn is being cultivated now and<br>
it is not uncommon to find yields of&nbsp; 100 bushels to the acre and
under<br>
the most favorable circumstances even twice that much has been raised on<br>
a single acre. The prevailing high prices make the corn crop<br>
particularly valuable.<br>
<br>
Stock-raising, which has never been indulged in to any extent, now gives<br>
excellent returns. The mules which are used so extensively in the South<br>
are being raised at home instead of being brought from the North. Beef<br>
animals and hogs are increasing in numbers and are being bred more<br>
carefully. The great variety of food crops which ripen in rotation make<br>
the cost of hog-raising very little--possibly two cents a pound will<br>
cover the cost of raising, butchering, and packing. Sheep flourish in<br>
the pine regions where they are remarkably free from diseases. They<br>
range all the year, needing little attention.<br>

<br>
<br>
This shift in agricultural pursuits has been due in a measure to the<br>
appearance of the boll-weevil which wrought havoc with the cotton crop<br>
for some years. It is possible that the change has been decidedly<br>
beneficial when one notes that the value of products in 1899 was<br>
$705,000,000 and in 1909 about $1,430,000,000.<br>
<br>
Agriculture is not the only interest of the New South. Northern capital<br>
has worked wonders along industrial lines. Some communities have changed<br>
entirely from agriculture to manufacturing. South Carolina is now second<br>
among the States in the manufacture of cotton; North Carolina is third,<br>
and Georgia is not far behind. In Alabama Southern tobacco is<br>
manufactured. The steel and iron industries, the furniture industry, the<br>
cottonseed-oil industry, and others are constantly becoming more<br>
important. The effects of this industrial revolution are far reaching.<br>
Social lines are shifting; a new society based upon business success and<br>
wealth seems to be supplanting or at least breaking in upon the<br>
aristocracy of the ante-bellum South, based upon family and public<br>
service. The ideal of success is changing and the ambitious young man<br>
now goes into business, manufacturing, or engineering as often as into<br>
the profession of law and politics. The laboring class has changed also.<br>
Years ago this class lived on farms and raised raw materials: now it<br>
lives in the cities and fashions raw materials. The same social results<br>
are found here as elsewhere, but on account of the conservatism and<br>
personal independence of the Southern laborer, who is only a generation<br>
removed from the soil, these results are not in evidence so soon. In the<br>
manufacturing districts there is the political unrest characteristic of<br>
the North. Labor unions develop here and Socialism has some adherents.<br>
This tends to break the political solidarity of the section and it is<br>
possible that in the not distant future the "Solid South" may pass away.<br>
<br>
The South is enthusiastic; it is alert to its opportunities and it is<br>
planning with hope for the future. Through practical education wonders<br>
may be worked, and upon this practical education for the rising<br>
generation the South bases its hopes. The new generation will make<br>
greater strides in the utilization of the great natural gifts than the<br>
old one has. The race problem will be solved in time, and the solution<br>
must come through the efforts of the Southern people, for the best<br>
classes now believe that the South can prosper best when all the people,<br>
colored as well as white, are brought to the highest standard of their<br>
efficiency.<br>

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S SECOND TERM<br>
<br>
[1905-1907]<br>
<br>
On June 1, 1905, an exposition was opened at Portland, Oregon, in<br>
commemoration of the Lewis and Clark expedition (1804-1805). Four<br>
hundred acres of ground adjoining the principal residence district,<br>
overlooking the Willamette River, were set aside for this purpose. There<br>
were extensive exhibits by the United States, Great Britain, Canada,<br>
Holland, Italy, China, and other European and Asiatic countries. The<br>
fair was, in general, the expression of the life and history of the<br>
Pacific Northwest and the direct relationship between that region and<br>
the Orient. Many national congresses were held in conjunction with it,<br>
such as the American Medical Association, National Good Roads<br>
Association, and the National Conference of Charities and Correction.<br>
<br>
The different interstate commerce acts, beginning with that of 1887 and<br>
including the railroad rate bill of 1906, constitute a system of control<br>
established by the Federal Government over persons and corporations<br>
engaged in interstate or foreign commerce; this includes the carrying of<br>
persons and property by either rail or water. Pipe lines, telephone,<br>
telegraph, express, and sleeping-car companies are also brought under<br>
the same provisions. The administration of these laws was vested in the<br>
Interstate Commerce Commission consisting of seven members.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The important provisions of these laws may be summarized as follows:<br>
1. All charges must be just and reasonable. The commission was given<br>
power to fix maximum rates after investigation of a complaint by either<br>
party to a dispute over rates.<br>
2. Pooling agreements were prohibited.<br>
3. It was made unlawful to make discriminations by giving to any<br>
particular person, corporation, or locality an unreasonable advantage<br>
over others. Granting of passes was prohibited to other than railroad<br>
employees, and granting of rebates was forbidden.<br>
4. By the "long or short haul" clause it was made unlawful for a common<br>
carrier to charge more for the transportation of passengers, or the same<br>
kind of freight, over a shorter than a longer distance; provided the<br>
transportation was under substantially similar circumstances and<br>
conditions over the same line and in the same direction.<br>
5. All rates were required to be published and posted where they might<br>
be consulted by any person.<br>
6. Railroad companies were forbidden to engage in other lines of
business.<br>
7. Companies engaged in interstate commerce must have a uniform system
of<br>
accounting.<br>
8. They are required to make reports to the Interstate Commerce<br>
Commission regularly.<br>
<br>
This commission was also empowered to receive complaints, hear<br>
testimony, make orders correcting abuses, or investigate conditions<br>
without previous complaint. It was given the power to suspend the<br>
proposed increase of rates until their justice had been determined. Any<br>
person objecting to an order of the commission was empowered to appeal<br>
to the "Commerce Court," which was created, being made up of five<br>
circuit court Justices.<br>

Nearly all of the States have passed laws relating to the purity of<br>
goods sold to the public. Investigation showed, however, that twenty per<br>
cent of the articles of food in common use were adulterated. This led to<br>
the passing of a far-reaching measure by Congress, 1906, known as the<br>
Pure Food and Drugs law. It provides against the manufacture and sale of<br>
adulterated or misbranded foods, drugs, medicines, or liquors in the<br>
District of Columbia, the Territories, and the insular possessions of<br>
the United States, and prohibits the shipment of such goods from one<br>
State to another or to a foreign country. To the Department of<br>
Agriculture was given the power to enforce the law. Thus the public is<br>
protected against adulterated foods and medicines and dishonest and<br>
misleading labels, and honest manufacturers are protected against<br>
fraudulent competition.<br>
<br>
For a number of years some of the European countries condemned American<br>
packing-house products. Abuses in the processes of preparing preserved<br>
meats were brought vividly before Americans by Upton Sinclair in his<br>
novel "The Jungle." The Department of Agriculture took up the problem<br>
and a special investigation was ordered by President Roosevelt. The<br>
report showed the need for more rigid inspection, and the agitation<br>
throughout the country forced the House of Representatives, 1906,<br>
somewhat reluctantly, to adopt the President's recommendation for a<br>
thorough inspection, by government agents, of all processes and methods<br>
used in the meat packing-houses.<br>

Earthquake at San Francisco, April 18, 1906.<br>
Upheaval of sidewalk at Eighteenth and Capp Streets.<br>
<br>
<br>
Early in the morning of April 18, 1906, San Francisco was visited by one<br>
of the most dreadful disasters of modern times. An earthquake shock<br>
destroyed many of the important buildings in the business part of the<br>
city. Other cities and towns along the coast and in the Santa Clara<br>
Valley suffered greatly and a number of the buildings of Leland Stanford<br>
University, thirty miles south of San Francisco, were demolished. Ninety<br>
per cent of the loss in San Francisco was due to the conflagration which<br>
raged for two days. Fires broke out owing to the crossing of electric<br>
wires. The water-mains were old and poorly laid and the force of the<br>
earthquake had burst them. Firemen and soldiers fought the advance of<br>
the flames by destroying buildings with dynamite. Not until an area<br>
three miles in length and two miles in breadth, including all the<br>
business and the thickly settled residential sections, had been burned<br>
over was the advance of the flames stopped. The estimated loss of life<br>
was 1,000, and property valued at $300,000,000 was destroyed. Among the<br>
irreparable losses were several libraries, the collections of the<br>
California Academy of Sciences, and many works of art. The noted<br>
Bancroft Library with its collection of manuscripts was saved.<br>

five hundred thousand dollars was voted by Congress, and the total<br>
relief fund amounted to $20,000,000. There was little suffering for lack<br>
of food and water, owing to the co-operation of representatives of the<br>
Red Cross Association, a citizens' committee, and the United States army<br>
in distributing supplies.<br>

Liberal Arts Building from the Auditorium.<br>
<br>
<br>
On April 26, 1907, the Jamestown Exposition was opened. It was in<br>
commemoration of the first English settlement in America. The southern<br>
shore of Hampton Roads, forty miles southeast of old Jamestown, was<br>
selected as the site for the buildings. The historic idea was uppermost<br>
in the exposition.&nbsp; The colonial type of construction was dominant
and<br>
good taste and moderation were notable in the arrangement of the grounds<br>
and exhibits. Industrial and commercial progress were emphasized. The<br>
United States had a special exhibit to illustrate the work of the<br>
different departments. In the harbor, one of the finest in the world,<br>
was the greatest international naval display ever witnessed. Every<br>
variety of war-vessel in existence was on exhibition besides commercial<br>
and passenger boats from the great ports of the world.<br>

<br>
THE FINANCIAL PANIC OF 1907<br>
<br>
[1907]<br>
<br>
Popular opinion ascribed three reasons for the panic of 1907. The first<br>
of these was the attitude of the President toward certain great<br>
corporations. It is true that his attacks bared some of the most deeply<br>
rooted evils which have always been at the bottom of our<br>
panics--dishonesty in the administration of great aggregations of<br>
capital. Great were the lamentations and doleful the predictions of what<br>
would happen should the President not change his policy of enforcing the<br>
laws. The railway opponents of the President were sure the panic came<br>
from the Hepburn Bill, which was passed early in 1906. If this had been<br>
dangerous to the welfare of the railroads it is reasonable to assume<br>
that foreign capital would have been withdrawn from American railways<br>
and that American capitalists interested in railroads would have<br>
attempted to avert financial ruin by disposing of their holdings.<br>
Neither situation developed, for the European investors increased their<br>
holdings and American capitalists continued to plan still greater<br>
investments in railways.<br>
<br>
The second general explanation was found in the unsound and reckless<br>
banking in New York City. The dangers arising from trust companies had<br>
been known for several years. It came to be believed that the deposits<br>
in these trust companies were being misused by the bank officers for the<br>
promotion of various speculating schemes. The disclosures which came<br>
with the investigation of the insurance companies fixed these beliefs<br>
more firmly in the minds of the people, and the first break in<br>
confidence precipitated runs on the New York banks.<br>
<br>
The third explanation was that the panic was due to the defects in our<br>
American currency system.<br>
<br>
These were the popular explanations, but there were deep-seated causes<br>
which had worked to bring about the existing conditions. The crisis was<br>
world-wide and was felt most in the countries where there was a gold<br>
standard. In 1890 the world's supply of gold available for monetary use<br>
was hardly $4,000,000,000; in 1907 it was more than $7,000,000,000.<br>
Along with this went a rapid rise in the average price of commodities in<br>
gold-standard countries. Bank deposits in the United States in 1907 were<br>
three times as great as they were in 1897. Amidst all this prosperity<br>
there were forces which were bound to bring a reaction and among the<br>
most important of these was the demand for capital for conversion into<br>
fixed forms. Ready capital was also lessened relatively by the great<br>
losses experienced as a result of the Spanish-American War, the Boer<br>
War, the Japanese-Russian War, the San Francisco earthquake, and the<br>
Baltimore fire. These losses, which amounted to $3,000,000,000, came at<br>
a time when the world was just entering upon a period of great<br>
industrial activity and needed all its capital. Much capital was<br>
absorbed in the construction of railroads, industrial plants,<br>
development of foreign industries, etc. These conditions brought about a<br>
tightening of money rates in Europe and American financial centres;<br>
consequently rates of interest went up. Commercial paper which brought<br>
three to three and one-half per cent in New York in 1897 brought seven<br>
per cent in 1907.<br>

<br>
<br>
Closely allied to this movement was the increase in the number of<br>
securities issued by industrial concerns. A few resourceful men, in<br>
order to do away with the evils of unrestricted competition, devised a<br>
remedy in the form of mergers. Others of less capacity but greater<br>
daring saw opportunities for money-making, and a craze for mergers and<br>
for the incorporation of private enterprises swept over the country. By<br>
1907 there were at least $38,500,000,000 worth of securities in<br>
existence. The natural result was speculation. When investors began to<br>
fear the soundness of the securities a collapse of credit was due.<br>
<br>
The rapid development of trust companies had its effect. The cash<br>
reserves held by these companies were small; their investments were not<br>
always conservative and the depositors were often suspicious. This free<br>
expansion of business with little or no reference to cash reserve or<br>
capital gave rise to another cause for the panic, which was not a matter<br>
of money. It was a matter of what was in men's minds. There was a period<br>
of "muckraking" in which leaders financial and political were severely<br>
critcised. Whether or not this criticism was justified by the exposition<br>
of the frauds of the insurance companies and the questionable dealings<br>
of some other corporations need not be discussed. The criticism created<br>
an attitude of mind throughout the nation, and the first weakening of a<br>
bank brought on the deluge.<br>

<br>
<br>
To the ordinary observer the panic of 1907 will date from October 22,<br>
when the Knickerbocker Trust Company of New York closed its doors.<br>
Earlier in the month the Mercantile National Bank had gotten into<br>
difficulties and had appealed to the clearing-house committee for aid,<br>
which was given. Soon it was noted that the Knickerbocker Trust Company<br>
was in a precarious condition, and the directors, following the example<br>
of the other bank, appealed to the same committee.&nbsp; The
investigation of<br>
the committee showed the company insolvent and aid was refused. When the<br>
facts became known, a run on the bank began and it was compelled to<br>
close its doors. The lack of confidence in other financial institutions<br>
was soon shown by similar runs.<br>
<br>
No bank could stand the strain unaided. Now the Federal Government<br>
stepped in and Secretary of the Treasury Cortelyou came in person to New<br>
York and deposited $40,000,000 of the surplus from the United States<br>
Treasury to be used for the aid of beleaguered institutions. For more<br>
than a week the crowds of depositors sought their money. The lines were<br>
not broken at night until the police hit upon the plan of giving to each<br>
individual a ticket denoting his place in the line. The Trust Company of<br>
America alone paid $34,000,000 across its counters and still crowds<br>
thronged the streets. At length the enormous reserve of the Treasury was<br>
exhausted and it became necessary to delay and deliberately to make slow<br>
payments. Through loans made by other banks the Trust Company of America<br>
and the Lincoln Trust Company, which had endured the hardest sieges,<br>
were saved and now the panic entered its second stage.<br>
<br>

<br>
The country was thoroughly aroused, and to avoid a nation-wide raid upon<br>
banking houses the bankers took radical steps. The first measure<br>
resorted to was the enforcement of the rule requiring savings-bank<br>
depositors, at the option of the institution, to give sixty days' notice<br>
before withdrawing deposits. The second expedient was one which had been<br>
resorted to during former years of financial unsteadiness. "Emergency<br>
currency" was issued. This currency took various forms. (1) The<br>
clearing-house loan certificates issued in denominations ranging from<br>
$500 to $20,000, used for settling inter-bank balances; (2)<br>
clearing-house certificates in currency dimensions to be used by banks<br>
in paying their customers; (3) clearing-house checks which took the form<br>
of checks drawn upon particular banks and signed by the manager of the<br>
clearing-house; (4) cashier's checks (in opposition to the National Bank<br>
act) secured by approved collateral; (5) New York drafts which were<br>
cashier's checks drawn against actual balances in New York banks; (6)<br>
negotiable certificates of deposit, and (7) pay checks payable to bearer<br>
drawn by bank customers upon their banks in currency denominations.<br>
These were guaranteed by the firm which issued them.<br>
<br>
Other devices were used to aid the banks and to block the spread of the<br>
panic by limiting cash payments by the banks. The governors of Nevada,<br>
Oregon, and California declared legal holidays continuously for several<br>
weeks, thereby allowing the banks to remain closed. In some places the<br>
size of withdrawals was limited to $10 or $25 daily.<br>
<br>
The panic was felt to a great degree on the New York Stock Exchange<br>
because the banks refused to make loans, but this stringency was<br>
relieved by a bankers' pool, headed by J. P. Morgan, which loaned<br>
$25,000,000 at the prevailing rate of interest. With the strengthening<br>
of the Stock Exchange another stage of the panic passed.<br>

<br>
In spite of the use of the surplus of the Treasury the banks showed a<br>
loss of $50,000,000 in actual cash during the five weeks of the panic.<br>
Now demands were made on foreign countries for gold. The Bank of England<br>
made no move to block the great withdrawals of gold except to raise the<br>
official discount to seven per cent. The flow of gold did much to stay<br>
the ebb of confidence.<br>
<br>
Some contended for an issue of paper money and after a long discussion<br>
by the officials of the Treasury, it was decided to sell $50,000,000<br>
worth of Panama two per cent bonds and $100,000,000 worth of three per<br>
cent notes in the hope of calling from its hiding-place the money which<br>
was being hoarded. The result of the venture was not satisfactory and<br>
the loan operations soon ceased.<br>
<br>
Gradually financial affairs righted themselves. The emergency currency<br>
was redeemed, the runs on banks ceased, confidence slowly returned, and<br>
business picked up, although by the middle of 1908 the volume was<br>
scarcely half of what it had been a year before. The number of bank<br>
failures had been comparatively small. Only twenty-one banks were<br>
obliged to suspend payment, while in 1893 the number was 160.<br>

<br>
<br>
Naturally there was much discussion concerning the defects of our<br>
financial system, of the needs of elastic currency, of a central bank,<br>
etc., when the Sixtieth Congress met in December, 1907. Several bills<br>
were offered for the establishment of a central bank; some for the issue<br>
of a special currency by the government; others for the legalization of<br>
certificates and currency created by clearing-house associations. The<br>
aversion of the people to the centralization of the banking business in<br>
the hands of a few of the great money powers made the establishment of a<br>
central bank out of the question.<br>
<br>
The bills which were discussed at any length were the Fowler Bill, the<br>
Vreeland Bill, and the Aldrich Bill. The first was discarded, although<br>
it had merits, and the two branches of Congress were unable to agree<br>
upon either of the others. The result was a compromise measure which<br>
became the Aldrich-Vreeland Act.<br>
<br>
The important provisions of this act are as follows: (1) Ten or more<br>
national banking associations, each with an unimpaired capital and<br>
surplus of not less than twenty per cent and an aggregate capital and<br>
surplus of not less than $5,000,000, may form national currency<br>
associations. These associations are to have power to render available,<br>
for the basis of additional circulation, "any securities, including<br>
commercial paper, held by a national banking association."<br>
<br>
(2) To obtain this additional circulation, any bank belonging to a<br>
national currency association having circulating notes outstanding<br>
secured by United States bonds to an amount not less than forty per cent<br>
of its capital stock, and having the required unimpaired capital and<br>
surplus, may deposit approved securities with the currency association<br>
and be empowered by the Secretary of the Treasury to issue additional<br>
circulating notes to an amount not to exceed seventy-five per cent of<br>
the cash value of the securities. If the securities are State or<br>
municipal bonds the issue must not exceed ninety per cent of the market<br>
value of the bonds.<br>
<br>
(3) The banks and assets of all banks belonging to the currency<br>
association are liable to the United States for the redemption of this<br>
additional currency, and the association may at any time require that<br>
additional securities be deposited. All banks are held liable to make<br>
good the securities of any bank in the association.<br>

(4) The total amount of circulating notes outstanding for any bank shall<br>
not at any time exceed the amount of its unimpaired capital and surplus,<br>
neither shall the amount of such notes in the United States exceed<br>
$500,000,000 at any time. The amount issued in each State shall bear the<br>
same relation to the total amount issued in the United States as the<br>
unimpaired capital and surplus of the banks of that State bear to the<br>
unimpaired capital and surplus of the banks of the United States.<br>
<br>
(5) The tax on circulating notes secured by United States bonds bearing<br>
two per cent or less shall be one-half of one per cent; if secured by<br>
United States bonds bearing more than two per cent, the tax shall be one<br>
per cent. If the securities are other than United States bonds, the tax<br>
shall be at a rate of five per cent per annum for the first month and<br>
afterward an additional tax of one per cent per annum for each month<br>
until a tax of ten per cent per annum is reached.<br>
<br>
(6) The redemption of the notes may take place by the banks depositing<br>
with the Treasurer of the United States lawful money to replace the<br>
securities deposited.<br>
<br>
(7) The formation of a national monetary commission to inquire into and<br>
report to Congress necessary or desirable changes in the banking and<br>
currency laws was provided for.<br>

IMMIGRATION AND EMIGRATION<br>
<br>
[1907]<br>
<br>
Since the organization of our government nearly 29,000,000 foreigners<br>
have come to the United States. The flow of immigration first assumed<br>
large proportions during the decade 1831-1840 and since that time one<br>
wave after another has reached our shores. The last one, and the one<br>
which has caused the greatest alarm, gathered force about 1897 and<br>
reached its full tide in the first decade of the twentieth century, when<br>
over 8,000,000 aliens landed at our ports.<br>
<br>
During this period (1820-1910) the character of immigration has changed.<br>
Prior to 1880 the greater part of it came from northern Europe, but<br>
since that time the number has constantly fallen off, and the flow from<br>
southern Europe has greatly increased. During the decade 1871-1880<br>
Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Russia sent only 181,000 of 2,262,000 aliens<br>
who landed in the United States--about eight per cent. During the decade<br>
1901-1910, 8,130,000 immigrants came to our shores, and of these<br>
5,800,000, or over 70 per cent, were from these three countries. In 1901<br>
Austria-Hungary sent, 113,400; in 1907 about 338,500, but owing to the<br>
passage of the immigration law in 1907 the number fell abruptly, but by<br>
1910 had again increased to 260,000. The same is true of Italy. In 1901<br>
about 136,000 came; in 1907 nearly 286,000, and in 1910 about 215,500.<br>
Russia sent 85,000 in 1901, some 260,000 in 1907, and 187,000 in 1910.<br>
The numbers from northern Europe do not approach these. The immigration<br>
from the British Isles does not reach the 100,000 mark; from Germany<br>
only 30,000 come yearly.<br>
<br>
Causes for this influx are varied. Many come desirous of owning homes, a<br>
pleasure out of reach in their home country on account of high prices.<br>
Free institutions attract others. A land which offers free schools to<br>
all regardless of race or creed, religious freedom, and the opportunity<br>
to play some part in the political life of the state is naturally<br>
attractive. Some come to escape military service, others with the idea<br>
of making money and returning to their native land. Density of<br>
population and the accompanying excessive competition in the struggle<br>
for existence also play a part.<br>
<br>
Hundreds of letters telling of the general prosperity in America and<br>
contrasting this with the condition at home, do their work with the<br>
disheartened peasants. It is said that half of our immigrants come on<br>
tickets paid for by friends in America. The large employers of labor,<br>
and even the States themselves, are constantly calling for laborers.<br>
Ours is a huge, half-developed country, and the development of our<br>
resources, particularly the coal and iron industries, the cotton; rice,<br>
cane, and tobacco industries, and the railways demands thousands of<br>
helpers.<br>
<br>

Emigrants bound for America.<br>
<br>
<br>
The steamship companies which have found an extremely profitable<br>
business in the transportation of immigrants have used various means to<br>
increase the numbers. Agents are said to be in all European countries<br>
soliciting trade. Associations for the assistance of poor emigrants have<br>
been formed in various European cities--this is especially true among<br>
the Jews who, by means of societies such as the "Hebrew Shelter" of<br>
London, have aided thousands of Roumanian and Russian Jews on their way<br>
to America.<br>

<br>
<br>
Although most of the European countries have placed restrictions upon<br>
emigration, these restrictions unfortunately do not retard the<br>
emigration of the undesirable classes. As a result America was called<br>
upon early to legislate on this problem. The first act was in 1819 and<br>
was aimed to regulate the transportation of immigrants. The laws of<br>
1875, 1882, 1891, 1893, and 1903 dealt with the class of immigrants to<br>
be admitted. The acts did not accomplish the end for which they were<br>
framed, and the question was taken up again by Congress which, after a<br>
lengthy discussion, passed the act of 1907.&nbsp; No great change in
policy<br>
was effected by this law which, for the most part, only revised the<br>
wording of the old laws and modified the methods of regulation. The head<br>
tax of two dollars, hitherto levied on each alien, was doubled but was<br>
made inapplicable to immigrants from our insular possessions or to<br>
aliens who had resided for a year either in the British possessions in<br>
North America, or in Cuba or Mexico. All aliens suffering from<br>
tuberculosis or loathsome diseases or those who were "mentally or<br>
physically defective, such mental or physical defect being of a nature<br>
which may affect the ability . . . to earn a living," were excluded.<br>
Children under sixteen unaccompanied by a parent were excluded.<br>
Steamship companies were placed under additional restrictions to insure<br>
against their violation of the act. Should an immigrant within a period<br>
of three years be found to have entered the country contrary to the<br>
terms of the act, he was to be deported and the transportation company<br>
responsible for his coming would be held liable for the expense of his<br>
deportation.<br>
<br>
The effect of the new law can be seen in the immigration statistics--the<br>
number of immigrants for the year 1908 is but little more than half as<br>
great as the number for 1907. The chief decrease was in the stream from<br>
southern Europe. This decrease cannot be attributed entirely to the act<br>
of 1907, but must be accounted for in part by the panic of 1907.<br>
Observations extending over a long period of years have disclosed the<br>
fact that the ebb and flow of the tide of immigration is closely<br>
attached to the periods of economic prosperity and depression.<br>
<br>
When the races of northern Europe contributed the greater part of our<br>
immigrants there was a general feeling that this was a decided advantage<br>
to us. The people were readily assimilated into our population and were<br>
in general intelligent, industrious citizens who soon acquired a<br>
patriotic love for America and its institutions.&nbsp; The serious
problems<br>
came with the increased number of southern Europeans.<br>
<br>

faiths in the station or "model town" of the<br>

<br>
<br>
For years Italians emigrated to South America, particularly to Brazil<br>
and the Argentine Republic, where the climate, race customs, and<br>
language were more to their liking than in the north. A diminution of<br>
prosperity there has turned part of the tide northward. About eighty per<br>
cent of our Italians come from southern Italy, a fact explained by the<br>
difference between the industrial conditions in the northern and<br>
southern parts of the peninsula. In the south agriculture is the only<br>
industry, and it frequently suffers from climatic conditions, the<br>
resulting losses bearing heavily upon the population. Conditions are<br>
aggravated by an unequal division of taxes between the north and the<br>
south. Often the only alternative to starvation is emigration. During<br>
the past decade 2,000,000 Italians have come to us and, according to<br>
estimates, about two-thirds of them have settled in the cities of the<br>
Northern States, a condition detrimental to the foreign and our social<br>
organization alike. These Italians, peasants and experts in fruit<br>
culture by training, become day laborers, thus losing their greatest<br>
productive power. The Italian who keeps away from the city finds his lot<br>
more agreeable. Wherever they have settled as farmers they have been<br>
uniformly successful. The person who knows only the Italian of the<br>
tenements has little sympathy for him, in spite of the fact that many of<br>
this race have proved themselves to be quiet, sober, and useful<br>
citizens.<br>

<br>
<br>
The Slavic immigration since 1880 has been mainly from the more<br>
primitive districts out of touch with the civilization of western<br>
Europe. These people have come, not as settlers, but as laborers in the<br>
mines, factories, and foundries, planning to remain here for a time,<br>
earn as much as possible, and return to their native land.<br>
<br>
In 1899 statistics began to be compiled by means of which the race and<br>
nationality of aliens might be determined. From 1899 to 1907 about<br>
seventy-two per cent of the Slavic immigration came from<br>
Austria-Hungary. Since 1900 at least 100,000 aliens from this country<br>
have come to the United States each year; in 1905, 1906, and 1910 the<br>
number exceeded 250,000 each year, and in 1907 it was 340,000. In this<br>
crowd came Bohemians, Poles, Slovaks, Ruthenians, Slovenians, Croatians,<br>
Bulgarians, Servians, Montenegrins, and other allied peoples. They are<br>
distributed over various parts of the land. Pennsylvania, on account of<br>
its mines, gathers by far the greatest number--in 1906 there were about<br>
500,000 Slavs in the State; New York had nearly 200,000, and Illinois<br>
about 134,000. The Bohemians and Poles seem inclined to farm, but in the<br>
main the Slav laborers have busied themselves in the coal, coke, iron,<br>
and steel industries. Very seldom do the Slavs take to petty street<br>
traffic, as do the Jews and Italians, but prefer the harder and better<br>
paid work in the mines and foundries.<br>
<br>
The Russians make the smallest Slavic group in America. Although many<br>
Russians are reported among the immigrants, only about five per cent are<br>
native born Russians, the rest being Jews, Poles, Finns, and<br>
Lithuanians.<br>
<br>
About one-eighth of our European immigrants are Jews. By the law of 1769<br>
the Jews in Russia are compelled to live within certain territorial<br>
limits known as the Jewish Pale, and about ninety-four per cent comply<br>
with the regulation. The law of 1882 has further restricted the places<br>
of residence, for Jews are now prohibited from buying or renting lands<br>
outside the limits of the cities or incorporated towns. Their<br>
educational advantages are limited by law; few are admitted to the bar<br>
and few to the other learned professions. To these disabilities the<br>
Russian government has added the terror of persecution, which will<br>
explain why 150,000 Jews come to America each year. In all there are<br>
1,250,000 here.<br>

The question of Oriental immigration has caused much comment in our<br>
Pacific Coast States for several years. Before 1900 the total number of<br>
Japanese coming to America seldom reached 1,500 a year. Since that time<br>
about 12,000 have come each year, except in 1903 when 20,000 came and<br>
1907 when the number reached 30,000. Seventy per cent of this number,<br>
however, went to Hawaii. Over-population and economic depression in<br>
their native land have caused this exodus. Most of these immigrants are<br>
laborers--skilful, energetic and efficient--who apparently desire to<br>
become citizens. Among the better classes are many who have attained<br>
eminence in various lines of work in our country. In scientific<br>
investigation the names of Takamine, Noguchi, Yatsu, Takami, Asakawa,<br>
and Iyenaga are well known. The names of those who have been more than<br>
ordinarily successful in business would make a long list. The most<br>
serious objections to the Japanese arise in the coast States where these<br>
immigrants have raised a serious labor problem. The people of these<br>
commonwealths also fear a race problem which in gravity will rival the<br>
one in the Southern States. It is claimed that even now, when the number<br>
of Orientals is small, the enforcement of law is exceedingly difficult<br>
in the Chinese quarters, while the control of the Japanese is next to<br>
impossible since they do not congregate in certain sections of the<br>
cities as do the Chinese. It is claimed that the 2,000,000 whites who<br>
live on the Pacific Coast will be swamped and lose control of the<br>
government if this Oriental immigration is not entirely prohibited. The<br>
Chinese do not cause so much anxiety. Since the passage of the exclusion<br>
act thirty years ago, few have come to the United States--scarcely more<br>
than 2,000 a year. As laborers they are efficient, patient, and honest<br>
in keeping labor contracts.<br>

GROUPS OF IMMIGRANTS UPON THEIR ARRIVAL AT ELLIS ISLAND<br>
<br>
<br>
These swarms of foreigners who come to us each year are causing<br>
uneasiness in the minds of the thinking people. Can our foreign<br>
population be growing more rapidly than our power to assimilate it? Is<br>
this element as dangerous to our civilization as we think? Has<br>
criminality increased as a result of increased immigration? Has this<br>
element increased labor agitations during the past decade? Some contend<br>
that we are rapidly approaching the limit of our power of assimilation<br>
and that we are in constant danger of losing the traits which we call<br>
American. The immigrants from southern Europe are in too many cases<br>
deficient in education. This lack of education may or may not prove a<br>
danger. So far it seems to have been the rule that in the second<br>
generation these foreigners have shown themselves extremely anxious to<br>
take advantage of the opportunities offered by our free schools.<br>
<br>
One of the most serious charges made against the Americanized foreigner<br>
has been that through him there has developed in our political system a<br>
strain of corruption which endangers our institutions. Political<br>
corruption did not come with the immigrants: it was known in all its<br>
forms years ago. This much can be said, however: the worst class of<br>
foreign-born citizens has ever proved to be a support of corrupt<br>
political bosses. Our city governments have been notoriously corrupt and<br>
the cities harbor the great masses of foreigners. The high cost of<br>
living in the cities and the relatively low wages force the aliens into<br>
poor and crowded quarters which tend to weaken them physically and<br>
degrade them morally and socially. Among the Italians of the cities<br>
there appears to be a vicious element composed of social parasites who<br>
found gambling dens, organize schemes of black-mail, and are the agents<br>
of the dreaded Black Hand. It is the class which furnishes aids for the<br>
lowest political bosses and furnishes the bad reputation for the<br>
Italians.<br>

<br>
An investigation of the nationalities in the city of Chicago has been<br>
made by Professor Ripley, of Harvard. The results illustrate the<br>
wonderful dimensions of the problem which the cities confront in the<br>
assimilation of the foreign element. In the case of Chicago, were the<br>
foreigners (those not American beyond the third generation) to be<br>
eliminated, the population would dwindle from 2,000,000 to about 100,00.<br>
In this city fourteen languages are spoken by groups of not less than<br>
10,000 persons each. Newspapers are regularly published in ten different<br>
languages and church services conducted in twenty different tongues.<br>
Measured by the size of its foreign colonies, Chicago is the second<br>
Bohemian city in the world, the third Swedish, the fourth Polish, and<br>
the fifth German. There is one large factory employing over 4,000 people<br>
representing twenty-four nationalities. Here the rules of the<br>
establishment are printed in eight languages. So it is with the other<br>
cities. New York, for example, has a larger Italian population than<br>
Rome, and is the greatest Jewish city, for there are in the city some<br>
800,000 Jews. In all eighty per cent of the population of New York are<br>
foreigners or the children of foreigners. In Boston the per cent reaches<br>
seventy and in Milwaukee about eighty-six.<br>
<br>
The charge that criminality has increased rapidly with the increased<br>
immigration from southern Europe seems to be substantiated by<br>
statistics. From 1904 to 1908 the number of aliens charged with<br>
committing grave crimes nearly doubled. While this fact will not prove<br>
the point, it suggests thought on the question.<br>
<br>
It has been truthfully said that the fundamental problem in this<br>
question of immigration is most frequently overlooked. Back of the<br>
statistics of illiteracy, pauperism, criminality, and the economic value<br>
of immigrants lies another one of great proportions. What has been the<br>
effect upon our native stock? What has been the expense, to our native<br>
stock, of this increase of population and wealth through immigration?<br>
The decreasing birth rate of our native population some contend is due<br>
to the industrial competition caused by the foreign element. If this be<br>
true, the foreigners have supplanted not supplemented the American, and<br>
the question arises, how long can the assimilation go on before we lose<br>
our American characteristics?<br>

The number of Europeans who return to their native lands after living a<br>
time in the United States is comparatively small and the loss is not<br>
great. The emigration of our farmers to Canada is a more serious thing.<br>
Since 1897 the Dominion Government has fostered high-class immigration.<br>
Canadian agencies have been established in many of our Western cities<br>
with the avowed object of attracting farmers to the Provinces. The<br>
Canadian Pacific Railway Company has taken up the pioneering business.<br>
It sells the land, builds the home and the necessary buildings, breaks<br>
the fields, plants the first crop, and hands over to the prospective<br>
settler a farm under cultivation. In return the railway demands<br>
high-class immigrants and, to insure this, no settler can take<br>
possession of a railway farm unless he can show $2,000 in his own right.<br>
Between 1897 and the close of 1910 Canada gained by immigration nearly<br>
2,000,000 inhabitants. Of these, 630,000 were from the United States,<br>
and it is estimated that those who went from the United States during<br>
the past five years took with them $267,000,000 in cash and settlers'<br>
effects. The end of the movement has not come, for the railway companies<br>
have now gone into the reclamation of arid lands. Since 1908 over<br>
1,000,000 acres of arid land in Alberta have been placed under<br>
irrigation, and the work of reclaiming another equally large section has<br>
begun. The American farmers who are taking advantage of this opportunity<br>
form a class which we cannot afford to lose.<br>

NOTABLE SUPREME COURT DECISIONS<br>
<br>
[1907]<br>
<br>
The Northern Securities Company is a corporation, formed under the laws<br>
of New Jersey, for the purpose of obtaining control of a majority of the<br>
stock of the Northern Pacific Railroad and part of the stock of the<br>
Great Northern Railroad. These roads, which parallel each other from<br>
Lake Superior to the Pacific, have been held by the courts, in the case<br>
of Pearsall vs. the Great Northern Railway, to be competing lines.<br>
<br>
The organizers of the Northern Securities Company contended that their<br>
ultimate purpose in organizing the company was to control the two<br>
railway systems not for the purpose of suppressing competition, but to<br>
create and develop a volume of trade among the States of the Northwest<br>
and between the Orient and the United States by establishing and<br>
maintaining a permanent schedule of cheap transportation rates.<br>
<br>
When the company had completed its organization and the full<br>
significance of the organization was known, the State of Minnesota<br>
instituted proceedings against the company in the State courts. Later<br>
the case was transferred to the federal Circuit Court and eventually<br>
carried to the Supreme Court of the United States, where the contentions<br>
of the State were overruled.<br>
<br>
In March, 1902, a suit was instituted by the United States in the<br>
Circuit Court of the eighth federal district. The judges who sat upon<br>
the case decided unanimously that the acquisition of the stock of the<br>
Northern Pacific and the Great Northern Railways by the Securities<br>
Company was a combination for the restraint of trade among the States,<br>
and therefore a violation of the Sherman act. A decree was issued by the<br>
court prohibiting the company from acquiring any more of the stock of<br>
these roads and from exercising any control over either of the roads in<br>
question.<br>

Justices of the United States Supreme Court who acted upon the cases of<br>
the Standard Oil and American Tobacco Companies.<br>
<br>
<br>
The case was carried to the Supreme Court which by a vote of five to<br>
four, affirmed the decree of the lower court. In the majority opinion<br>
the court took the position that the mere acquisition by the Securities<br>
Company of the stock of the two roads was in itself a combination for<br>
the restraint of trade. The power to do things made unlawful by the<br>
Sherman act had been acquired and this in effect violated that act.<br>
<br>
Another point was made clear by the court. The defendants had vigorously<br>
denied that the power of Congress over interstate commerce was extended<br>
to the regulation of railway corporations organized under State laws, by<br>
reason of these corporations engaging in interstate commerce. The court<br>
declared that while this was not the intention of the Government, the<br>
Government was acting within its rights when it took steps, not<br>
prohibited under the Constitution, for protecting the freedom of<br>
interstate commerce. Furthermore, it was held that no State corporation<br>
could stand in the way of the enforcement of the national will by<br>
extending its authority into other States. In substance the court denied<br>
the right of any State to endow a corporation of its creation with power<br>
to restrain interstate commerce.<br>
<br>
The contention of the defendants, that the Sherman law was intended to<br>
prohibit only those restraints which are unreasonable at common law, was<br>
dismissed on the ground that this question had been passed upon by the<br>
lower court in other cases.<br>
<br>
The dissenting opinions were two in number and were written by Justice<br>
White and Justice Holmes.<br>
<br>
Several conclusions of importance may be drawn from the court's<br>
decision.<br>
<br>
1. That Congress may forbid transactions of purchase and sale when such<br>
transactions confer on an individual or group of individuals the power<br>
to destroy competition.<br>
<br>
2. No State can create corporations and confer upon them power to<br>
interfere with interstate commerce.<br>
<br>
3. The Sherman law is not to be interpreted as forbidding the reasonable<br>
restraints of trade which are not objectionable at common law.<br>
<br>
The Bailey case is one of importance by reason of the fact that the<br>
decision handed down by the Supreme Court was an effective blow against<br>
the "peonage system," which is an evasion of the constitutional<br>
prohibition of slavery. The Alabama law provides, in effect, that the<br>
mere act of quitting work on the part of a contract laborer is<br>
conclusive evidence that he is guilty of the crime of defrauding his<br>
employer.<br>
<br>
Alonzo Bailey was engaged by a corporation to do farm work and signed a<br>
contract for a year, the wages being $12 a month. The company, to bind<br>
the contract, paid Bailey $15 down and it was agreed that thereafter he<br>
should be paid at the rate of $10.75 a month. After working a month and<br>
a few days he left. Instead of suing him for a breach of contract and<br>
recovery of damages, the company caused the arrest of Bailey on the<br>
charge of an attempt to defraud. No direct evidence could be produced<br>
that this was his intention, but the law expressly authorized the jury<br>
to find him guilty of fraud, on the ground that he quitted work. The<br>
accused was not allowed to testify as to his unexpressed intention. His<br>
opportunity to escape prison was to pay back the $15 or to work out the<br>
sum. In case neither was done, he was to be fined double the amount paid<br>
at the time of making the contract or go to work at hard labor.<br>
<br>
The attorneys for Bailey, wishing to test the constitutionality of the<br>
Alabama law, carried the case to the Supreme Court of the United States.<br>
The constitutionality of the law was called into question on the<br>
following grounds: (1) That it violated the prohibition against<br>
involuntary service; (2) it denied the plaintiff in error the right of<br>
due process of law; (3) that by laying a burden on the employee and no<br>
equivalent burden on the employer, the law denied to the plaintiff the<br>
constitutional right of equal protection of the laws.<br>
<br>
The decision of the court was not unanimous. Justices Holmes and Lurton<br>
upheld the Alabama law, but the majority, in an opinion written by<br>
Justice Hughes, declared the law in conflict with the Thirteenth<br>
Amendment, which prohibits slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a<br>
punishment for crime.<br>
<br>
The significance of the decision is this--slavery has been outlawed by<br>
our highest court, and one more legal barrier to the progress of the<br>
black man has been removed.<br>
<br>
The case of Loewe vs. Lawler, probably better known to the public as the<br>
Danbury Hatters&nbsp; case, was decided by the Supreme Court in
February,<br>
1908, Chief Justice Fuller rendering the decision. The action was<br>
brought originally in the United States Circuit Court for the District<br>
of Connecticut and, after passing through the Circuit Court of Appeals,<br>
reached the Supreme Court late in 1907.<br>

<br>
<br>
The plaintiffs, who were manufacturers of hats, complained that the<br>
defendants--members of the United Hatters of North America, an<br>
organization which was a part of the American Federation of Labor--were<br>
"engaged in a combined scheme and effort to force all manufacturers of<br>
fur hats in the United States, including the plaintiffs, against their<br>
will and their previous policy of carrying on their business, to<br>
organize their workmen . . . into an organization of the said<br>
combination known as The United Hatters of North America, or, as the<br>
defendants and their confederates term it, to unionize their shops, with<br>
the intent thereby to control the employment of labor in, and the<br>
operation of, said factories . . . and to carry out such scheme, effort<br>
and purpose by restraining and destroying the interstate trade and<br>
commerce of such manufacturers by means of intimidation of, and threats<br>
made to such manufacturers and their customers in the several States, of<br>
boycotting them, their product and their customers . . . until . . . the<br>
said manufacturers should yield to the demand to unionize their<br>
factories."<br>
<br>
These methods had been successfully employed before, as is evidenced by<br>
the fact that seventy of the eighty-two manufacturers of fur hats had<br>
been compelled to accept the conditions set forth by the American<br>
Federation of Labor. The boycott against the Danbury, manufacturers<br>
began in July, 1902, and was widened to include the wholesalers who<br>
handled the goods of the Danbury concern, the dealers who bought from<br>
the wholesalers, and customers who bought from these dealers. Notices to<br>
this effect were printed in the official organs of the American<br>
Federation of Labor and the United Hatters of North America. To make the<br>
feeling against the manufacturers more intense, statements were<br>
published to the effect that they were practising an unfair, un-American<br>
policy in discriminating against competent union men in favor of the<br>
cheap unskilled foreign labor.<br>
<br>
The counsel for the defence argued that no case could be set up under<br>
the Sherman act, since the defendants were not engaged in interstate<br>
commerce, implying that a combination of laborers was not a violation of<br>
the act. The court held that an action could be maintained in this case<br>
and that the combination as it existed was "in restraint of trade" in<br>
the sense designated by the act of 1890. The significance of the<br>
decision lies in the fact that the Supreme Court made no distinctions<br>
between classes. Records of Congress show that efforts were made to<br>
exempt, by legislation, organizations of farmers and laborers from the<br>
operation of the act and that their efforts failed. Therefore the court<br>
held that every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of<br>
trade was illegal and cited a former decision (The United States vs.<br>
Workingmen's Amalgamated Council) to show that the law interdicted<br>
combinations of workingmen as well as capital.<br>
<br>
The Sherman act was passed by Congress in 1890. It was entitled "An Act<br>
to Protect Trade and Commerce against Unlawful Restraints and<br>
Monopolies." Since its passage various cases falling under it have been<br>
decided, but until the decisions in the Standard Oil Company and the<br>
American Tobacco Company cases the extent and intent of this act have<br>
not been understood.<br>
<br>
In the Standard Oil case the question involved was this: Was the Sherman<br>
act violated by the existence and conduct of this corporation, which<br>
owned or controlled some eighty corporations originally in competition?<br>
The control had been acquired for the purpose of monopolizing the sale<br>
and distribution of petroleum products in the United States, and had<br>
been acquired by various means of combination with the intent either by<br>
fair or unfair methods "to drive others from the field and to exclude<br>
them from their right to trade."&nbsp; The proof was that, to destroy<br>
competitors, prices had been temporarily reduced in various localities,<br>
spies had been used on competitors' business, bogus independent<br>
companies operated, and rebates given and taken.<br>
<br>
In the case of the American Tobacco Company, there were more than one<br>
hundred formerly competing companies united under the control of a<br>
single organization and the market in nearly all tobacco products was<br>
monopolized. This domination was secured "by methods devised in order to<br>
monopolize the trade by driving competitors out of business."<br>
<br>
In each case the court found the defendants guilty on the grounds that<br>
the agreements and the conduct of the defendants indicated a purpose to<br>
destroy competitors and monopolize trade in certain articles. The<br>
desired result was accomplished by wrongful means which injured the<br>
public as well as the competitors.<br>
<br>
The facts in neither case required the consideration of the question as<br>
to whether the Sherman act prohibited every unification of formerly<br>
competing properties and every restraint of trade, reasonable or<br>
unreasonable but, owing to the uncertainty of the public concerning the<br>
meaning of the law, the court stated definitely the meaning and scope of<br>
the act. From appearances the Supreme Court has practically amended the<br>
Sherman act by limiting its application to "unreasonable" restraints of<br>
trade. The significance of the decisions lies here rather than in the<br>
fact that both companies were compelled to dissolve. The best legal<br>
authorities believe that the new interpretation of "reasonableness" and<br>
"unreasonableness" of restraint of trade has increased rather than<br>
decreased the effectiveness of the law, inasmuch as the meaning has<br>
always been obscure. The new policy is a notification to combinations of<br>
capital that to exist without prosecution they must not resort to any<br>
unfair, oppressive, or illegal methods to control competition or crush<br>
competitors.<br>

While President Roosevelt advocated peace, he believed that the best<br>
means to preserve peace was suitable preparation for war. In his message<br>
to Congress, 1904, he said; "There is no more patriotic duty before us<br>
as a people than to keep the navy adequate to the needs of this<br>
country's position. Our voice is now potent for peace, and is so potent<br>
because we are not afraid of war. But our protestations would neither<br>
receive nor deserve the slightest attention if we were impotent to make<br>
them good." At all times he urged a larger and more efficient navy. For<br>
years, before he became Assistant Secretary of the Navy, he had been a<br>
student of naval affairs. He found that there was no programme for<br>
building ships as in the European countries, and that there was general<br>
unpreparedness for war.<br>
<br>
Before the war with Spain, the American navy was so inferior that it was<br>
excluded from any table of the principal navies of the world. Had the<br>
United States possessed a few more battleships at that time, it is<br>
probable that war would not have occurred. Spanish authorities had been<br>
told by naval experts that their navy was superior to ours.<br>
<br>
Profiting by that experience, plans for a larger navy were projected. By<br>
the close of the year 1907 there were about 300 vessels in the navy<br>
manned by 35,377 men. In comparative strength it ranked second only to<br>
that of Great Britain. Not only was there an increase in the number of<br>
vessels but there was great improvement in marksmanship and in the<br>
handling of ships. In the battle of Santiago it has been estimated that<br>
about five per cent of the shells struck the enemy. During the year 1902<br>
Rear-Admiral Robley D. Evans introduced regular and frequent target<br>
practice. So effective was this work that in 1908, at ranges twice as<br>
great as at Santiago, gunners throughout the fleet averaged sixty per<br>
cent and one vessel scored eighty per cent. Rapidity of fire also was<br>
increased nearly fourfold.<br>
<br>
It was the custom to send the fleet each winter to the Caribbean Sea for<br>
manoeuvres, which lasted about four months. In December, 1907, the<br>
Atlantic fleet, comprising sixteen battle-ships and a flotilla of<br>
torpedo-boats, began a cruise around the world. President Roosevelt<br>
steadily adhered to the plan in the face of the most extravagant<br>
denunciation on the part of those who declared that it could be<br>
considered only as a menace toward Japan. Naval experts claimed,<br>
however, that the experience to be gained by this cruise, such as<br>
practice in handling ships in all kinds of weather, the renewal of<br>
stores and coal, and the meeting of other problems incident to actual<br>
warfare, justified the experiment.<br>

<br>
Under command of Rear-Admiral Evans the fleet reached Rio Janeiro on<br>
January 12. Unusual honors were tendered the men by the Brazilian<br>
government and people. The day of their arrival was made a national<br>
festival. In reply to the friendly greeting from the Brazilian<br>
government President Roosevelt wrote: "The war-ships on this cruise<br>
exist for no other purpose than to protect peace against possible<br>
aggression. As between the United States and Brazil these ships are not<br>
men-of-war, but messengers of friendship and good-will." There were<br>
similar manifestations on the part of Argentina, Chile, and Peru. The<br>
visit of the fleet to these countries was regarded as a compliment. They<br>
were permitted to see something of the strength of the republic at the<br>
north and learned that the Monroe Doctrine might be enforced, if need<br>
be, by a navy of the first rank. Notable ceremonies attended the arrival<br>
of the fleet at Honolulu, Auckland, Sydney, Melbourne, and Manila. A<br>
despatch to a London paper said: "It is beyond question that the United<br>
States is no longer a Western but a cosmic power. America is now a force<br>
in the world, speaking with authoritative accent, and wielding a<br>
dominant influence such as ought to belong to her vast wealth,<br>
prosperity, and importance."<br>

Rear-Admiral Charles S. Sperry.<br>
<br>
<br>
At Auckland Rear-Admiral Evans, who had spent forty-eight years in the<br>
navy, having reached the age limit of sixty-two years, was succeeded in<br>
command by Rear-Admiral Sperry. Unusual honors were accorded the fleet<br>
by Japan. Each American warship was escorted into the harbor of Yokohama<br>
by a Japanese vessel of the same class and many other evidences of<br>
friendship were manifest during their visit. The fleet then proceeded to<br>
China, through the Suez Canal and the Strait of Gibraltar, and at the<br>
end of one year and sixty-eight days, after covering 45,000 miles,<br>
dropped anchor in Hampton Roads. The accomplishment of this feat,<br>
without precedent in naval annals, still farther contributed to the<br>
establishment of the prestige of the United States as a great world<br>
power.<br>
<br>
In 1889 the government of the United States purchased from the Indians a<br>
large irregular tract of land not then occupied by them and erected it<br>
into a separate territory under the name of Oklahoma. When it was opened<br>
for settlement, April 22, 1889, a horde of settlers who had been waiting<br>
on the borders rushed in to take possession of the lands. Cities and<br>
towns sprang up as if by magic. The loose system of government exercised<br>
by the five civilized tribes became steadily more ineffective when the<br>
Indian Territory was thus brought into contact with white settlers. By<br>
1893 affairs had become so confused that Congress decided to take steps<br>
toward the ultimate admission of the territory into the Union as a<br>
State. A committee of the Senate reported that the system of government<br>
exercised by the Indians cannot be continued, that it is not only<br>
non-American but it is radically wrong, and a change is imperatively<br>
demanded in the interest of the Indians and the whites alike, and such<br>
change cannot be much longer delayed, and that there can be no<br>
modification of the system. It cannot be reformed; it must be abandoned<br>
and a better one substituted.<br>
<br>
Gradually the five tribes--Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, and<br>
Seminole--were shorn of their governmental powers. Lands were allotted<br>
in severalty, certain coal, oil, and asphalt lands being reserved. A<br>
public school system was established and maintained by general taxation.<br>
<br>
In his message to Congress, 1905, President Roosevelt recommended the<br>
immediate admission of Oklahoma and Indian Territory as one State and<br>
Arizona and New Mexico as another. A statehood bill embodying this<br>
recommendation was passed by the House, but was amended in the Senate so<br>
as to strike out the provision relative to the admission of New Mexico<br>
and Arizona. Opposition to the admission of the last two territories as<br>
one State came principally from the great mining companies of Arizona<br>
supported by the railroad corporations. They were in practical control<br>
of the territory with hundreds of millions of dollars in property. They<br>
were fearful of the loss of control and an increase of taxation under<br>
such a combination. Finally an act was passed by Congress, in 1906,<br>
enabling the people of Oklahoma and Indian Territory to form a<br>
constitution and State government and be admitted into the Union. The<br>
enabling act provided that all male persons over the age of twenty-one<br>
years who were citizens of the United States or who were members of any<br>
Indian nation or tribe in said Oklahoma and Indian Territory, and who<br>
had resided within the limits of said proposed State for at least six<br>
months next preceding the election, should be entitled to vote for<br>
delegate or serve as delegates in a constitutional convention. A number<br>
of Indians were delegates in this convention. The constitution, which<br>
was adopted by the voters, September 17, 1907, was greatly criticised on<br>
account of its radicalism. The new State, the forty-seventh, was<br>
formally proclaimed by the President in 1908. It has an area of 70,000<br>
square miles. In 1900 the population was 800,000 which was increased to<br>
1,500,000 by the date of admission. The wonderful climate and fertile<br>
soil together with the energy of its population have continued to<br>
attract thousands of immigrants each year.<br>
<br>
The exclusion of Japanese students from the public schools of San<br>
Francisco, 1906, seemed&nbsp; for a time to augur grave results.
One-half of<br>
the ninety Japanese who were in attendance upon these schools were above<br>
sixteen years of age and were taught in the classes with little<br>
children. The order of the San Francisco school board excluding the<br>
Japanese was in harmony with the California law which permitted local<br>
school boards to segregate Mongolians in schools apart from those for<br>
white children. But this order nullified our treaty with Japan which<br>
provided that the subjects of that nation should be granted the same<br>
personal rights when in this country that our own citizens enjoy.<br>
<br>
President Roosevelt acted with promptness and decision. His attitude was<br>
shown in his message to Congress, December, 1907, in which he said: "To<br>
shut them out from the public schools is a wicked absurdity . . . .<br>
Throughout Japan Americans are well treated and any failure on the part<br>
of Americans at home to treat the Japanese with a like courtesy and<br>
consideration is by just so much a confession of inferiority in our<br>
civilization . . . . I ask fair treatment for the Japanese as I would<br>
ask fair treatment for Germans or Englishmen, Frenchmen, Russians, or<br>
Italians .... In the matter now before me, affecting the Japanese,<br>
everything that is in my power to do will be done, and all of the<br>
forces, military and civil, of the United States which I may lawfully<br>
employ will be so employed."<br>
<br>
But the problem was not settled, for early in the year 1909<br>
anti-Japanese resolutions were brought before the legislatures of<br>
California, Nevada, Oregon, and two or three other Pacific States. The<br>
bills before the legislature of California provided:<br>
<br>
1. For the segregation of Japanese and other Orientals in residential<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; quarters at the option of municipalities.<br>
<br>
2. That aliens should not own land in California.<br>
<br>
3. That aliens should not become directors in California corporations.<br>
<br>
4. For separate schools for Japanese students.<br>
<br>
<br>
On February 8, President Roosevelt sent a telegram to the Speaker of the<br>
California assembly giving the Government's views on the pending bills.<br>
"The policy agreed to by both governments," he said, "aims at mutuality<br>
of obligation and behavior. In accordance with it the purpose is that<br>
the Japanese shall come here exactly as Americans go to Japan, which is<br>
in effect that travellers, students, persons engaged in international<br>
business, men who sojourn for pleasure or study, and the like, shall<br>
have the freest access from one country to the other, and shall be sure<br>
of the best treatment, but that there shall be no settlement in mass by<br>
the people of either country in the other." While there is nothing in<br>
the Constitution or laws to prevent the President from urging a State<br>
legislature to vote for or against certain pending bills, such a course<br>
is unusual. It had become a national question, however, and the<br>
President's energy in handling the problem is worthy of praise.<br>
<br>
According to the census of 1900, there were over 700,000 children under<br>
sixteen years of age at work in the mills, mines, factories, and<br>
sweat-shops of the United States. Nearly all of the States had<br>
child-labor laws, but they were ordinarily poorly enforced and no State<br>
was wholly free from the blight of this child slavery. While fourteen<br>
years was the minimum in most of the States, a few permitted the<br>
employment of children of ten years of age. In the majority of cases<br>
there was no legal closing hour after which children might not be<br>
employed.<br>

The subject was given national prominence through the Beveridge-Parsons<br>
Bill introduced into the Senate, December, 1907, marking an epoch in the<br>
history of federal legislation. This bill proposed to exclude from<br>
interstate commerce all products of mines and factories which employ<br>
children under the age of fourteen. The bill was not, however, brought<br>
up for discussion. The leading arguments of its opponents were as<br>
follows: (1) That the question was local only; (2) there was no reason<br>
to believe that federal would be better than State administration; (3)<br>
that it was limited in effect since it could not prevent children being<br>
employed in the manufacture of goods to be sold within a State. A bill<br>
passed both houses and was signed by the President, authorizing the<br>
Secretary of Commerce and Labor "to investigate and report on the<br>
industrial, social, moral, educational, and physical conditions of woman<br>
and child workers of the United States, wherever employed, with special<br>
reference to their age, hours of labor, term of employment, health,<br>
illiteracy, sanitary and other conditions surrounding their occupation,<br>
and the means employed for the protection of their health, persons, and<br>
morals." An appropriation of $150,000 was made with which to carry on<br>
this investigation. Among the demands of the National Child Labor<br>
Committee have been a shorter day's work for children between the ages<br>
of fourteen and sixteen, health certificates for factory employment in<br>
dangerous trades, and the regulation of children in street trades.<br>

Electric train, Long Island R. R.<br>
<br>
<br>
The period of Mr. Roosevelt's administrations was notable on account of<br>
advances made in various other directions. Electricity was applied to<br>
new and larger uses. Power was transmitted to greater distances. Niagara<br>
Falls was made to produce an electric current employed leagues away.<br>
Electric railways, radiating from cities, converted farms and sand-lots<br>
into suburban real estate quickly and easily accessible from the great<br>
centres. Telephone service was extended far into country parts, and,<br>
with the rural free delivery of mail, brought farmers into quick and<br>
inexpensive communication with the outside world, robbing the farm of<br>
what was once both its chief attraction and its greatest<br>
inconvenience--isolation.<br>

Guglielmo Marconi and his wireless telegraph.<br>
<br>
<br>
German experiments developed an electric surface car with a speed of two<br>
miles a minute. Wireless telegraphy came into use. By means of high<br>
masts rigged, with wires diverging to the earth somewhat like the frame<br>
of a partly opened umbrella, it was found possible under favorable<br>
atmospheric conditions to telegraph hundreds of miles through the air.<br>
The most notable use of this invention was to communicate between ships<br>
and the shore or between ships at sea, a particularly desirable facility<br>
in fog, storm, or darkness, when other signals were useless.<br>

<br>
<br>
Electricity and the gasolene engine were applied to bicycles, vehicles,<br>
and boats, often generating sufficient power to run a small factory.<br>
Bicycles somewhat passed from vogue, but automobiles became fashionable,<br>
partly for rapid transit, partly for work formerly consigned to heavy<br>
teams. Auto-carriages capable of railway speed, varying indefinitely in<br>
style and in cost, might be seen upon the smoother roads about cities<br>
all the way from Maine to California. They exerted great influence in<br>
inducing communities to macadamize roads, for which the passing of the<br>
stage-coach and the spread of railroads had diminished the demand.<br>

The "Arrow" getting under way.<br>
<br>
<br>
Effort with flying machines was incessant but only partially successful.<br>
No air-ship had thus far been devised which could undertake a definite<br>
voyage of length with any certainty of reaching its destination. The<br>
best feat yet was that of the air-ship Arrow, which, October 25, 1904,<br>
at St. Louis, made a ten-mile trip. On the other hand, the development<br>
of boats able to carry life for hours beneath the surface of the sea<br>
added a new form of attack and defence against the well-nigh<br>
impenetrable sides and enormously powerful guns of modern naval ships.<br>
<br>
About 1890 the use of the Australian ballot system became general, and<br>
thus the purchase of votes became more difficult. But this reform did<br>
not eliminate the evils of machine politics. State laws were extended to<br>
the control of party affairs, with severer punishments for corrupt<br>
practices, the control of lobbying, and the requirement of publicity for<br>
campaign expenses. In a few States the primary election system was put<br>
into operation. Public officers won popular approval in numerous States<br>
and cities by their activity in revealing "graft" and by their fearless<br>
enforcement of the law.<br>
<br>
These reforms were made possible by the increase of independent voting<br>
in State and city politics. Politicians must reckon, as never before,<br>
with the demand of the average citizen for honesty in public service.<br>
The influence of corporations in governmental affairs received a check,<br>
and there came to be a growing demand for the more complete control of<br>
public utilities, and for the public ownership of them in cities.<br>

The prominence of the moral element in the business and political<br>
reforms mentioned above characterizes this as an era of "awakened civic<br>
conscience." Both moral and economic considerations may be seen in the<br>
protest against the excessive use of alcoholic liquors that has resulted<br>
in the prohibition of liquor selling in a number of States and parts of<br>
States, especially in the South. Educationally, the period showed<br>
increased attention to the industrial and practical aspects of school<br>
work. Courses in manual training came to be regarded as necessary for<br>
the complete development of mind and body. Physical education received<br>
greater attention. The establishment of public libraries, aided by the<br>
munificent gifts of Andrew Carnegie, was rapid.<br>
<br>
Millions of dollars, also, were contributed to the cause of education<br>
and research. Among the most notable of these gifts were those by Mr.<br>
Carnegie for the establishment of the Carnegie Institution and the<br>
Carnegie Foundation, and the contribution to the General Education Board<br>
by John D. Rockefeller. In 1902 the Carnegie Institution at Washington<br>
was established by a gift of $10,000,000 by Andrew Carnegie. This sum he<br>
afterward increased to $25,000,000. The work of the institution is to<br>
carry on scientific study and research. Material is being collected for<br>
the economic history of the United States, and students of American<br>
history have been aided by the catalogues showing the location of<br>
documentary and other source material. While the head-quarters of the<br>
Institution is in Washington, important departments are located<br>
elsewhere throughout the country. There is a laboratory at Tucson,<br>
Arizona, for the study of desert plant life; a biological laboratory at<br>
Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island; a marine biological laboratory at<br>
Tortugas, off the Florida coast, and an astronomical observatory at<br>
Mount Wilson, California.<br>

CARNEGIE FREE PUBLIC LIBRARIES.<br>
<br>
<br>
May 6, 1905, the announcement was made of a gift of $10,000,000 for the<br>
purpose of providing retiring pensions for the teachers of colleges,<br>
universities, and technical schools in the United States, Canada, and<br>
Newfoundland. In making the gift Mr. Carnegie wrote: "I hope this fund<br>
may do much for the cause of higher education and to remove a source of<br>
deep and constant anxiety to the poorest paid and yet one of the highest<br>
of all professions." The fund was to be applied without regard to age,<br>
sex, creed, or color. Sectarian institutions, so-called, or those which<br>
require a majority of their trustees, officers, faculty, or students to<br>
belong to a specified sect, or which impose any theological test<br>
whatever, were excluded by the terms of the gift. Universities supported<br>
by State taxation were at first excluded, but a supplementary gift by<br>
Mr. Carnegie of $5,000,000, in 1908, extended the privileges of the<br>
foundation to these universities.<br>
<br>
In February, 1907, John D. Rockefeller increased the money at the<br>
disposal of the General Education Board by a gift of $32,000,000. This<br>
fund, which had been originally established by him, amounting to<br>
$11,000,000, had been used chiefly for the improvement of education in<br>
the South. Common schools were aided, high-schools established, and<br>
instruction in agriculture fostered. The additional sum was to be<br>
devoted to lending assistance to certain selected colleges, with the<br>
stipulation that the college was to raise three times the amount of<br>
money granted it by the Board.<br>

THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF 1908<br>
<br>
[1908]<br>
<br>
In spite of the oft-repeated statement made by President Roosevelt that<br>
he would not be a candidate for nomination on the Republican national<br>
ticket in 1908, the party leaders seemed to fear a stampede in the<br>
Chicago convention. Plans had been laid carefully by the party leaders<br>
to prevent this possibility, and when William H. Taft, of Ohio, received<br>
the nomination on the first ballot, delegates and spectators gave vent<br>
to their feelings by prolonged applause. Out of a total of 980 ballots<br>
cast Mr. Taft received 702. As Secretary of War in President Roosevelt's<br>
cabinet he had been chosen by the President to succeed him, for it was<br>
believed that through training and sympathy he was best fitted to carry<br>
out the policies of the administration.<br>
<br>
Other candidates for nomination had appeared during the summer and each<br>
had a following of more or less strength. Senator La Follette, of<br>
Wisconsin; Governor Hughes, of New York, and Speaker Cannon, of<br>
Illinois, each received some support in the convention. Throughout the<br>
land no surprise was occasioned, however, by the nomination of Mr. Taft.<br>
Apparently the nomination of James S. Sherman, of New York, for the<br>
office of Vice-President was the result of political expediency; he was<br>
a good organization man; he had enjoyed considerable experience in<br>
public affairs and had been a member of Congress for twenty years.<br>
Moreover, the fact that he came from New York made it a wise move,<br>
politically, to give him a place on the ticket.<br>

To outside observers the convention was a harmonious one, ready and<br>
anxious to adopt and indorse the Roosevelt policies and to accord a most<br>
hearty support to the candidate who best represented these policies. The<br>
platform which was drawn up was a strong political document which not<br>
only stated the Republican policies clearly but was also a piece of<br>
campaign literature of some note from the stand-point of literary worth.<br>

James S. Sherman, nominated for Vice-President.<br>
<br>
<br>
Throughout the months preceding the assembling of the Democratic<br>
convention, in Denver, there was some uncertainty as to who would<br>
control it. Governor Folk, of Missouri, had been much in the public eye<br>
through his war on graft and on account of his successful administration<br>
of the gubernatorial office. Judge Gray, of Delaware, who had served his<br>
State in the United States Senate and had acquired an enviable<br>
reputation as a justice of the United States Circuit Court, was also a<br>
strong candidate. Judson Harmon, of Ohio, Attorney-General under<br>
President Cleveland, and Governor Johnson, of Minnesota, had numerous<br>
supporters.<br>
<br>
When the voting began in the convention the result was not long in<br>
doubt. William Jennings Bryan was for the third time accorded the honor<br>
of leading the Democratic party. On the first ballot Mr. Bryan received<br>
892-1/2 votes; Judge Gray, his chief opponent, received 59-1/2. The<br>
cheers which followed the announcement of the vote showed that two<br>
defeats had not dampened the loyalty of the Western Democrats. Mr. Kern,<br>
of Indiana, was nominated by acclamation for the Vice-Presidency. The<br>
committee on the formation of the platform seemed to have some<br>
difficulty in determining the final form of some of the planks.<br>
<br>
Both parties in their platforms favored tariff revision. The Republican<br>
party declared for the protective system and reciprocity and promised a<br>
special session of Congress to treat the whole tariff question. The<br>
Democratic party adhered to the old principle of "tariff for revenue"<br>
and pledged itself to return to that basis as soon as practicable.<br>
Furthermore, it pledged itself to bring about immediately such<br>
reductions as would put trust-controlled products upon the free list and<br>
to lower the duties on the necessaries of life, particularly upon those<br>
which were sold more cheaply abroad than at home. Lumber was to go on<br>
the free list. Any deficiency in the revenues which might arise from<br>
this policy was to be made up through the medium of an income tax.<br>
<br>
Both platforms declared for reform in the currency laws, but neither one<br>
advanced any plan for revision. The Democratic platform condemned as<br>
criminal the large expenditures of the recent administration, but showed<br>
some inconsistency by favoring such policies as a large navy, generous<br>
pensions, large expenditures for the improvement of rivers and harbors<br>
which would necessitate the expenditure of great sums.<br>
<br>
The regulation of railways and corporations was demanded by both<br>
parties. The difference between the demands lay in the means to be<br>
employed. The Democratic platform declared for State control of this<br>
question as well as that relating to the conservation of our natural<br>
resources. The Republicans took the stand that both questions should be<br>
solved by the Federal Government.<br>
<br>
In treating the problem of the alien races the Republican document<br>
referred to the negro race by name, demanded equal justice for all men,<br>
and condemned the devices used by some States for disfranchising the<br>
negro. Nothing was said concerning Chinese and Japanese immigration. The<br>
Democratic platform was silent on the negro question and declared<br>
against the admission of Orientals into our country.<br>
<br>
Arbitration was favored by the Republicans, but was not mentioned in the<br>
opposition platform. On the Philippine question there was a division.<br>
The Republicans favored a gradual development of home-rule; the<br>
Democrats for early independence under an American protectorate.<br>
<br>
Three things in the Democratic platform are worthy of note: (I) The<br>
demand for a federal law compelling publicity of campaign contributions;<br>
(2) the election of senators by direct vote, and (3) the adoption of<br>
such parliamentary rules as would make the House of Representatives a<br>
deliberative body.<br>
<br>
The Socialist convention, which assembled in Chicago, nominated Eugene<br>
V. Debs for President and Ben Hanford for Vice-President.<br>
<br>
Two tendencies of political thought were displayed in the Socialist<br>
platform as framed by the committee. First, a tendency away from<br>
individual ownership of productive property and the individual<br>
administration of industry, and toward the collective ownership of<br>
productive property and the collective administration of industry. This<br>
was illustrated by the demands made for the collective ownership of all<br>
railways, steamship lines, and other means of transportation, as well as<br>
telephones, telegraphs, etc. It was further evidenced by the demand that<br>
the public domain be made to include mines, quarries, oil wells,<br>
water-power, reclaimed and reforested lands. The second tendency was<br>
away from a form of government of checks and balances toward one by the<br>
unrestrained majority. This was shown by the demands for the abolition<br>
of (I) the Senate, (2) the veto power of the President, (3) the power of<br>
the Supreme Court to pass on the constitutionality of legislation.<br>
<br>
Industrial demands were made. There should be a more effective<br>
inspection of workshops and factories; there should be no employment of<br>
children under sixteen years of age; interstate transportation of the<br>
products of child labor or convict labor should be forbidden; compulsory<br>
insurance against unemployment, illness, accidents, old age, and death<br>
should be adopted.<br>
<br>
Among the political reforms demanded were inheritance and income taxes,<br>
equal suffrage for men and women, the initiative and referendum,<br>
proportional representation, and the right of recall. The Federal<br>
Constitution was to be amended by majority vote. Judges were to be<br>
elected for short terms.<br>
<br>
The nominees of the Prohibition party were Eugene W. Chapin, of<br>
Illinois, for President, and Aaron S. Watkins, of Ohio, for<br>
Vice-President. In the platform framed there were the usual declarations<br>
against the liquor traffic, but there were also planks demanding<br>
reforms.&nbsp; The election of senators by direct vote; the passage of<br>
inheritance and income taxes; the establishment of postal savings banks;<br>
the guaranty of bank deposits; the creation of a permanent tariff<br>
commission; the conservation of natural resources; an equitable and<br>
constitutional employers' liability act, and legislation basing suffrage<br>
only upon intelligence and ability to read and write the English<br>
language, were the chief planks. Beyond any doubt this platform--the<br>
shortest of all--shows that the men who constructed it were not<br>
dreamers. It is possible that the delegates may have been looked upon as<br>
visionaries, for there were few among them who could be called<br>
"practical politicians," but, as one writer of note has said, the<br>
delegates were "typical of that class of society on which the nation<br>
ever depends in a great crisis, the sort from which all moral movements<br>
spring. . . ."<br>
<br>
It has often been said that the excitement of presidential campaigns is<br>
detrimental to the nation. This could hardly be said of the campaign of<br>
1908. To produce political excitement there must be debatable questions<br>
termed, by the politicians as "issues." Just what the issues were in the<br>
campaign few people could determine. There were no issues which involved<br>
foreign affairs. The Democratic party did not criticise the sending of<br>
the fleet around the world, the administration's policy in Cuba, the<br>
policy concerning the Panama Canal, nor even the policy pursued in the<br>
Philippines. As regards military and naval matters, pensions to<br>
veterans, the development of internal waterways, the conservation of<br>
resources, etc., there were no issues simply because the people had<br>
practically the same views about them. Consequently issues had to be<br>
made, and, generally speaking, the Republican leaders appealed to the<br>
people along the lines of the personal fitness of the candidates.<br>
<br>
It was pointed out that President Roosevelt had indicated his Secretary<br>
of War as the best man to carry out the policy inaugurated by the<br>
administration of subduing and controlling influential law-breakers. The<br>
chief officer of the government has vested in himself powers of wide<br>
range--the appointment of the judiciary, the superintendence of the<br>
administration of the business affairs of the nation, the guidance of<br>
our international affairs. Therefore the President must be a keen judge<br>
of men capable of distinguishing the honest, efficient servant of the<br>
nation from the self-seeking politician; he must resist political<br>
pressure; he must be national in his patriotism and breadth of vision;<br>
he must know our foreign relations intimately, that the continuity of<br>
policies may not be broken and the efficiency of our foreign service<br>
weakened thereby. He must have the capacity to work long hours, with<br>
skill, care, and rapidity. In short, the chief executive must be a man<br>
who is fit mentally and physically.<br>

<br>
<br>
Some of these essential qualities the candidates of the two great<br>
parties possessed in a high degree. They were honest and sincere; they<br>
were familiar with the desires and needs of the various sections of the<br>
nation; they were national in the breadth of their policies. But they<br>
were different in temperament, equipment, and experience, and upon this<br>
difference the Republican leaders made their appeal to the voters.<br>
<br>
The Democratic nominee was essentially an orator--he swayed the masses<br>
by his denunciation of the perils which threatened the nation through<br>
the concentration of wealth which had gone on under the Republican rule.<br>
His opponents admitted that a man of his stamp was invaluable to the<br>
American people, but they contended that his place was in the editor's<br>
chair, in the pulpit, or upon the lecture platform, not as the chief<br>
executive of the nation. Furthermore, it was said that this great orator<br>
had views on political, social, and economic questions which bordered on<br>
the visionary, and that any man who had openly supported free silver,<br>
anti-imperialism, or even the guaranty of bank deposits, could not be<br>
safely trusted with the guidance of the nation's destinies.<br>
<br>
The Republican candidate had none of the qualifications of an orator; he<br>
was rather a teacher. He did not cater to the desires of his audience;<br>
he struck at the abuses most prevalent in the section where he spoke. It<br>
was his business to point out weaknesses; to find remedies for them; to<br>
educate, not sway, his audiences. His mind was constructive; his<br>
training had been along the lines of constructive political thought; he<br>
had proven his ability by his organization of a civil government for the<br>
Philippines and by his solution of the vexed question of Cuba. So it was<br>
argued that the best test of his ability and guaranty of efficiency was<br>
the work he had already done.<br>
<br>
The campaign was lacking in life and enthusiasm simply because there<br>
were no clearly defined issues. The candidates went through the usual<br>
performances of "swinging around the political circuit." Mr. Taft was<br>
accorded a warm welcome on his trip, for the people wished to get<br>
acquainted with President Roosevelt's choice as much as to hear him<br>
discuss the Republican policies. Mr. Bryan, who conducted a great<br>
speaking campaign, confined his attention to advocating the bank<br>
guaranty plan and to attacking the evils of private monopoly. Political<br>
enthusiasm was at a low ebb. Few people took matters seriously and the<br>
campaign was aptly characterized as the "Era of No Feeling."<br>
<br>
The vote cast for presidential electors was primarily an expression of<br>
popular confidence in the Roosevelt administration. For nearly half a<br>
century the situation in the nation had been becoming more and more a<br>
source of anxiety to the thinking men of the land. Our economic<br>
development had taken place so rapidly that the great aggregations of<br>
capital and the great corporations had gotten beyond control and had<br>
shown dangerous tendencies toward lawlessness and political corruption.<br>
The feeling that the great corporations were not only beyond the control<br>
of law but even controlled the government in the interests of a few, led<br>
to a belief that the government was passing out of the hands of the<br>
people, and that the function of our republican government was being<br>
arrested. The radical and the agitator were getting the ear of the<br>
nation, for the faith of the nation was shaken. Then came President<br>
Roosevelt to take up a task of greatest difficulty, and for nearly eight<br>
years, amidst the applause of the plain people, he administered the<br>
affairs of the nation firmly, honestly, and with efficiency. The<br>
Republican convention in Chicago by its nomination of Mr. Taft had put<br>
the stamp of its approval upon the Roosevelt administration, and turned<br>
to appeal to the voters.<br>

Presidency, on the veranda of the residence of his brother, Mr. Charles<br>
P. Taft, of Cincinnati, Ohio.<br>
<br>
<br>
In round numbers Taft received 7,680,000 votes and Bryan 6,410,000. The<br>
electoral vote stood 321 for the Republican candidate and 162 for the<br>
Democratic candidate. Thirty States elected Republican presidential<br>
electors; eighteen elected Democratic electors. With the exception of<br>
Nebraska, Nevada, and Colorado, which together contributed sixteen<br>
electoral votes, all the States carried by the Democratic nominee were<br>
Southern States. The nation had approved the Roosevelt policy, but the<br>
great popular vote for Mr. Bryan showed clearly the loyalty of millions<br>
of voters. These men believed that their leader stood for the plain<br>
people--for the unprivileged. There were many who had feared Mr. Bryan's<br>
policies in 1896, who voted for him in 1908 because they believed that<br>
twelve years of public life and the study of national problems had<br>
changed and bettered his ideals.<br>
<br>
Some Republican writers professed to believe that the popular vote<br>
indicated that a majority of people adhered to the policy of protection.<br>
To others it appeared that the voters were willing to accept the<br>
protective policy with a promise for honest tariff revision in order to<br>
obtain a continuation of the Roosevelt policies.<br>
<br>
The popular vote is interesting mainly for what it showed concerning the<br>
changed strength of the small parties, During the period 1904 to 1908<br>
the drift had evidently been away from them. The Socialist vote was<br>
nearly as large in 1908 as in 1904, which was a consolation to<br>
Socialists, for they had held the ground gained by the heavy vote in<br>
1904. The Prohibition vote fell off about ten per cent from that polled<br>
in 1904 and the Independence party polled only 82,000 votes.<br>
<br>
In the House of Representatives the Sixty-first Congress had 219<br>
Republicans and 172 Democrats; the Senate 60 Republicans and 32<br>
Democrats.<br>

CHAPTER XV<br>
<br>
THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT TAFT<br>
<br>
[1909]<br>
<br>
On March 4, 1909, the date of the inaugural ceremonies, Washington was<br>
visited by a heavy snow-storm, and Mr. Taft, departing from the custom<br>
of delivering his inaugural address at the east end of the Capitol,<br>
spoke in the Senate chamber. Many trains bearing visitors to Washington,<br>
from various parts of' the country, were blockaded, This condition<br>
served to emphasize the call, many times made, for the transfer of the<br>
date of these services to April 30, the day on which President<br>
Washington took the oath of office.<br>
<br>
President Taft's inaugural address was wise and temperate and<br>
satisfactory to the country at large. He asserted that the most<br>
important feature of his administration would be the maintenance and<br>
enforcement of the reforms inaugurated by President Roosevelt. He<br>
justified appropriations, as his predecessor had done, for maintaining a<br>
suitable army and navy; advocated the conservation of our natural<br>
resources, the establishment of postal savings banks, and direct lines<br>
of steamers between North and South America.<br>

on the reviewing stand at the inauguration, March 4,1909.<br>
<br>
<br>
The cabinet was made up of men largely gathered from private life, a<br>
majority of them being comparatively unknown to the public. Philander C.<br>
Knox was United States senator from Pennsylvania when he was appointed<br>
Secretary of State. He had served as Attorney-General in President<br>
McKinley's cabinet. Franklin MacVeagh, of Illinois, who was made<br>
Secretary of the Treasury, had been prominent as a merchant in Chicago<br>
and active in public affairs. Mr. MacVeagh and Jacob M. Dickinson, who<br>
became Secretary of War, were both members of the Democratic party. By<br>
inviting Democrats to become members of his political family, President<br>
Taft desired to give recognition to the fact that he had been elected by<br>
Democratic votes and had received substantial support in parts of the<br>
South. Mr. Dickinson was also from Chicago. The Secretary of the Navy,<br>
George von L. Meyer, of Massachusetts, had served as ambassador to<br>
Russia, and later as Postmaster-General during Mr. Roosevelt's<br>
administration. Frank H. Hitchcock, of Ohio, who was made<br>
Postmaster-General, had served as First Assistant Postmaster-General.<br>
George W. Wickersham, an attorney of good standing in New York City, was<br>
appointed Attorney-General. Richard A. Ballinger, of Seattle, who had<br>
been Commissioner of the General Land Office, 1907-1909, was appointed<br>
Secretary of the Interior. James Wilson, of Iowa, who had served as<br>
Secretary of Agriculture since 1897, was continued in that office.<br>
Charles Nagel, a noted lawyer of St. Louis, was made Secretary of<br>
Commerce and Labor.<br>

With the beginning of the new administration the President's salary was<br>
increased to $75,000 a year; that of the Vice-President to $12,000; and<br>
members of the cabinet to $12,000.<br>
<br>
From June 1 to October 15 there was held at Seattle the<br>
Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. The rapid growth of Seattle has been<br>
due in no small degree to the fostering of trade with Alaska. The<br>
exhibits served to demonstrate the wisdom of the purchase of the<br>
territory, which at that time was characterized as Seward's "folly."<br>
Alaska has for some years been recognized as a country of wealth and<br>
opportunity. The gold output each year is more than three times the sum<br>
paid Russia for the territory. About one-fifth of the gold produced in<br>
the United States comes from Alaskan mines. Products amounting to<br>
$33,500,000 were shipped to the States from Alaska during the year 1907,<br>
and the return trade for that year amounted to $19,500,000. The value of<br>
the fishery products is five-sevenths as great as the output of the gold<br>
mines. Alaskan coal-fields are estimated to be even richer than her gold<br>
deposits. Other productions of the territory are silver, tin, lead,<br>
quicksilver, graphite, marble, lumber, grains, vegetables, and fruits.<br>
<br>
The purpose of the exposition was declared to be "to exploit the<br>
resources and potentialities of the Alaskan and Yukon territories; to<br>
make known and foster the vast importance of the trade of the Pacific<br>
Ocean and of the countries bordering thereon, and to demonstrate the<br>
marvellous progress of Western America." The energy and determination of<br>
the men of the new Northwest was well shown in the preparation made for<br>
the exposition. No financial assistance was asked from the federal<br>
government. The necessary $10,000,000 were contributed almost entirely<br>
in Seattle and the State of Washington. One million dollars were<br>
expended by Seattle, as a preparatory step, on her municipal<br>
improvements.<br>

The site of the exposition was the campus of the State University,<br>
between Lakes Washington and Union. From the grounds, notable for their<br>
natural beauty, were visible in the distance Mount Rainier, the loftiest<br>
peak in the United States, the snow-covered Olympics to the west, and<br>
the Cascade range to the east.<br>
<br>
Three permanent buildings were erected by the State of Washington with<br>
the understanding that they were afterward to be used by the university.<br>
Most of the structures followed the French Renaissance design. In the<br>
forestry building, which was 320 feet long and 140 feet broad, and built<br>
of logs in the rough, there were displayed the timber resources of<br>
Alaska and the Northwest. An out-door farm illustrated the agricultural<br>
resources of the region. The Japanese exhibit was second only in<br>
interest to that of Alaska. The exposition served to demonstrate, as it<br>
was intended to do, the possibilities for the investment of capital in<br>
the Northwest and the opportunities for those seeking new homes.<br>

The Hudson-Fulton Celebration.<br>
The Clermont proceeding up the Hudson River under her own steam.<br>
<br>
<br>
Beginning with September 25 and continuing throughout the first week of<br>
October, there was a notable celebration in New York City, and in other<br>
cities on the Hudson, commemorative of the discovery of that river by<br>
Henry Hudson three centuries before and the trip up the river by Robert<br>
Fulton's steamboat in 1807. The leading feature of the pageant was the<br>
assembling in the harbor of the largest fleet of international character<br>
ever brought together at one time, and the cruise up the Hudson as far<br>
as Newburg of eighty war vessels selected from the navies of the United<br>
States, Great Britain, Germany, France, and other powers. These huge<br>
vessels were in striking contrast to the two small ones which were given<br>
the place of honor in the pageant, the replicas of the Half&nbsp; Moon
and<br>
the Clermont. The land parades were likewise spectacular in their<br>
effects.<br>
<br>
In October, 1909, Commander Robert E. Peary and Dr. Frederick A. Cook,<br>
two American travellers, returned to the United States, both making<br>
claims to having discovered the north pole. The accomplishment of this<br>
task, which had baffled so many arctic explorers, was hailed as a<br>
triumph throughout the civilized world. Ardent supporters of each of<br>
these men began to champion the right of their favorite to the great<br>
honor. It was shown that Commander Peary had for twenty-three years been<br>
engaged in arctic exploration. His first voyage was made to Greenland in<br>
1886, and in his numerous expeditions to the frozen north since that<br>
time he had secured much scientific data relating to the glaciology,<br>
geology, and ethnology of those regions.<br>
<br>

Commander Peary's ship, The Roosevelt.<br>
<br>
<br>
When Commander Peary left the Roosevelt, the ship which bore him as far<br>
north as navigation permitted, on February 22, 1909, his expedition<br>
consisted of 8 white men, 59 Eskimos, 140 dogs, and 23 sledges, with the<br>
necessary equipment for arctic travel. Upon returning to the United<br>
States after overcoming the many dangers incident to such exploration,<br>
he submitted his records to the National Geographical Society. A<br>
committee of that body, after passing upon these documents, declared<br>
unanimously that it was their opinion that Peary had reached the north<br>
pole, April 6, 1909. This report further commended him for his<br>
organization and management of this expedition and for his contributions<br>
to scientific knowledge.<br>
<br>
Before his return to America, Dr. Cook had been hailed as the discoverer<br>
of the north pole by European scientists, especially those of Denmark,<br>
who accepted his story of the accomplishment of this task in April,<br>
1908, one year earlier than the date of Peary's discovery. Many honors<br>
were conferred upon him when he reached Copenhagen, September 4, 1909.<br>
He was met by the Crown Prince of Denmark and the American minister, and<br>
by explorers, professors, and scientists from various European<br>
countries. He was greatly honored also upon his return to New York City.<br>

Commander Robert E. Peary, and three<br>
of his Eskimo dogs, on The Roosevelt.<br>
<br>
<br>
Commander Peary declared that the claims made by Dr. Cook were without<br>
foundation. His decision was based on the evidence given by two Eskimos<br>
who had accompanied Dr. Cook, and who asserted that the party went only<br>
a two days' journey north from Cape Hubbard and were never beyond the<br>
land ice. Further evidence of deception by Dr. Cook was set forth by<br>
Edward M. Barrill, who had accompanied him on his ascent of Mount<br>
McKinley in 1906. This guide declared that Dr. Cook had not reached the<br>
summit of that mountain as claimed, but that the records had been<br>
falsified. Later, a commission was appointed by the University of<br>
Copenhagen to examine the notes and memoranda submitted to them by Dr.<br>
Cook. After a careful examination of these documents, the commission<br>
reported that they found no evidence sufficient to warrant the belief<br>
that Dr. Cook actually reached the north pole.<br>

By vote of Congress, June 20, 1910, the territories of Arizona and New<br>
Mexico were granted permission to form State constitutions. The<br>
constitutions which were framed in their conventions and passed by<br>
majorities of the people contained some unusual provisions. The Arizona<br>
constitution included the initiative, referendum, and recall of all<br>
elective officers, including judges. The New Mexico constitution<br>
contains a referendum clause, but the clause providing for initiative<br>
was rejected.<br>

President Taft signing the proclamation making<br>
Arizona the forty-eighth State of the Union,<br>
at the White House, February 14, 1912.<br>
<br>
<br>
The constitution of Arizona was attacked in Congress and opposed by<br>
President Taft on account of the provision for the recall of judges. The<br>
chief objection to the constitution of New Mexico was the unsatisfactory<br>
method provided for its amendment. This constitution, however, was<br>
approved by President Taft and by the House of Representatives, but the<br>
Senate failed to take any action. In August, 1911, the President vetoed<br>
a joint resolution to admit the territories of New Mexico and Arizona as<br>
States into the Union. He stated his attitude as follows: "The<br>
resolution admits both territories to statehood with their constitutions<br>
on condition that at the time of the election of State officers New<br>
Mexico shall submit to its electors an amendment to its new constitution<br>
altering and modifying its provisions for future amendments, and on the<br>
further condition that Arizona shall submit to its electors at the time<br>
of the election of its State officers a proposed amendment to its<br>
constitution by which judicial officers shall be excepted from the<br>
section permitting a recall of all elective officers. If I sign this<br>
joint resolution, I do not see how I can escape responsibility for the<br>
judicial recall of the Arizona constitution. The joint resolution admits<br>
Arizona with the judicial recall, but requires the submission of the<br>
question of its wisdom to the voters. In other words, the resolution<br>
approves the admission of Arizona with the judicial recall, unless the<br>
voters themselves repudiate it. . . . This provision of the Arizona<br>
constitution in its application to county and State judges seems to me<br>
pernicious in its effect, so destructive of independence in the<br>
judiciary, so likely to subject the rights of the individual to the<br>
possible tyranny of a popular majority, and therefore to be so injurious<br>
to the cause of free government that I must disapprove a constitution<br>
containing it."<br>

<br>
January 6, 1912, New Mexico, having complied with all conditions, was<br>
formally admitted into the Union as the forty-seventh State.<br>
<br>
Arizona, having an area of&nbsp; 113,000 square miles, was organized as
a<br>
territory in 1863 and appeared in the federal census reports for the<br>
first time in 1870 with a population of 9,658. From 1870 to 1890 its<br>
growth in population was rapid, increasing a little more than four times<br>
during the decade 1870-1880 and doubling during the succeeding ten<br>
years. The population in 1900 was 122,931 and in 1910 it was 204,354.<br>
During the last decade, therefore, the increase in population has been<br>
66.2 per cent, while the percentage of increase in the United States as<br>
a whole has been only 21 per cent. According to the thirteenth census,<br>
Arizona contained eight cities with an aggregate population of 58,414.<br>
The largest cities were Tucson, with a population of 13,193, and Phoenix<br>
with 11,134.<br>
<br>
Arizona produces more copper than any other State in the Union. Of the<br>
total copper ore mined in the United States (1909) 27.7 per cent was<br>
from Arizona. There are also good mines of gold and silver. Coal-mining,<br>
marble-quarrying, lumbering, raising cattle, sheep, and ostriches are<br>
also important industries in Arizona. Through the efforts of the<br>
Reclamation service in completing the Roosevelt Dam and a dam at Parker,<br>
and by the use of pumps, it is estimated that 1,000,000 acres of fertile<br>
land will become available for cultivation. Other large areas are also<br>
susceptible of irrigation.<br>
<br>
In 1850 the territory of New Mexico was organized and in 1863 it was<br>
reduced to its present limits with an area of 122,000 square miles. The<br>
population of New Mexico in 1900 was 195,310 and in 1910 was 327,301 an<br>
increase of 67.6 per cent. Albuquerque, with a population of 11,020, and<br>
Rosewell with 6,172 were the two largest cities. Like Arizona, New<br>
Mexico possesses great wealth in mines and forests, but the foundation<br>
for her future industrial progress lies in her farms. In 1910 New Mexico<br>
possessed 500,000 acres of irrigated land. It was estimated that<br>
3,000,000 acres more were amenable to artificial watering and the<br>
government is expending millions of dollars on projects which will<br>
fertilize vast areas of this land.<br>
<br>
During the year 1911 the world was astounded at the unparalleled<br>
exhibitions of the possibilities of the aeroplane. The dream of<br>
centuries had been realized, and American genius was responsible for the<br>
achievement. In 1896, a model machine which had been constructed under<br>
the direction of Professor Langley, secretary of the Smithsonian<br>
Institution, driven by a one horse-power steam-engine, made three<br>
flights of a mile each near Washington. Congress appropriated $50,000<br>
for the construction of a complete machine, but after two unsuccessful<br>
attempts to fly, with an operator, the project was abandoned.<br>
<br>
Wilbur Wright and his brother Orville, bicycle manufacturers of Dayton,<br>
Ohio, did not share in the general ridicule which followed this failure,<br>
and after three years of experimentation demonstrated that the<br>
principles upon which Professor Langley had constructed his machine<br>
were, in the main, sound. The first successful flight of a few seconds<br>
by one of their machines weighing 750 pounds was made in 1903. Two years<br>
afterward a flight of 24 miles was made at the rate of 38 miles an hour.<br>
Other successful experiments followed, and the claim of the Wrights to<br>
be considered the inventors of the first successful man-carrying flying<br>
machine was established. French inventors at about the same time were<br>
carrying on successful experiments with machines similarly constructed.<br>
September 16, 1908, Wilbur Wright, at Le Mans, France, demonstrated that<br>
his machine could remain in the air for over an hour and at the same<br>
time fly across country at a high speed. In that year, also, Orville<br>
Wright, in a government test at Fort Myer, Virginia, not only made<br>
flights lasting over an hour, but carried a companion with him. During<br>
July, 1909, a French aviator, Bleriot, flew across the English Channel,<br>
a distance of 32 miles. That year, also, Orville Wright ascended to the<br>
height of 1,600 feet; with a passenger, made a record flight of 1 hour,<br>
12 minutes and 36 seconds; and flew across country with a companion for<br>
10 miles at the rate of 42 miles an hour. Thus it was shown that a<br>
machine had at last been constructed which would not only fly, but would<br>
remain in the air at the will of its pilot and subject to his guidance.<br>

<br>
In the aviation meet at Los Angeles, January 10, 1910, Louis Paulhan, a<br>
Frenchman, established the record of 4,000 feet for height and Glenn H.<br>
Curtiss with a passenger set a new world's record of 55 miles.<br>
<br>
Shortly afterward Curtiss demonstrated for the first time that it was<br>
possible for an aeroplane, especially constructed, to rise from the<br>
surface of water, make a flight in the air, return to the<br>
starting-point, and again alight on the water.<br>
<br>
The great possibilities as well as the dangers connected with aviation<br>
were brought out in the meet at Chicago during August, 1911, where two<br>
aviators lost their lives. C. P. Rodgers, in a Wright machine, remained<br>
in the air twenty-six and one-half hours out of the possible thirty-one<br>
and one-half hours. Lincoln Beachey set a new world's record by<br>
ascending 11,642 feet. This record was again surpassed within a month by<br>
Ronald G. Garros, a French aviator, who ascended 13,943 feet.<br>

Harry K. Atwood flew from St. Louis to Chicago in one day, a distance of<br>
315 miles. He continued his flight to New York, and in eleven days<br>
reached that city. He had travelled 1,265 miles in the actual flying<br>
time of 28 hours. C. P. Rodgers eclipsed all records for long-distance<br>
aeroplane flying by crossing the continent from Sheepshead Bay, New<br>
York, to Pasadena, Cal., a distance of 4,231 miles. He accomplished this<br>
feat in the total time of 49 days, September 17 to November 5, 1911. His<br>
actual flying time was 82 hours.<br>

<br>
These flights served to demonstrate that the permanent triumphs of<br>
aeronautics are to be won by steadiness and efficiency and not by<br>
recklessness.<br>
<br>
Among the significant legislation of the Sixty-second Congress, the<br>
passing of the "publicity law," August, 1911, is deserving of especial<br>
commendation. The Democratic platform, 1908, demanded publicity of<br>
campaign contributions, and Mr. Bryan announced that no funds would be<br>
received from corporations. According to a New York statute, all<br>
campaign receipts and expenditures must be filed. The Republican<br>
campaign committee agreed to apply this law in the presidential contest.<br>
<br>
According to the federal Publicity law no candidate for member of the<br>
House of Representatives may spend more than $5,000 in his campaign for<br>
nomination or election, and no candidate for United States senator may<br>
spend, legally, more than $10,000 in his campaign. Candidates are<br>
prohibited from making promises of office or other promises in order to<br>
obtain votes, and no candidate for senator may aid in the election of<br>
members of the legislature that is to fill a senatorial vacancy. At the<br>
time, two United States senators were under indictment for the purchase<br>
of their seats, and one of them acknowledged that he had expended nearly<br>
$100,000 in his primary campaign.<br>
<br>
In partial fulfilment of the declaration that his policy was to bring<br>
about legislation for the benefit of the whole country, President Taft<br>
in his message to Congress, December, 1911, asked that the appointment<br>
of local federal officers throughout the country should be placed under<br>
the classified service. "I wish," he wrote, "to renew again my<br>
recommendation that all the local officers throughout the country,<br>
including collectors of internal revenue, collectors of customs,<br>
postmasters of all four classes, immigration commissioners, and marshals<br>
should be by law carried into the classified service, the necessity for<br>
confirmation by the Senate be removed, and the President and the others,<br>
whose time is now taken up in distributing this patronage, under the<br>
custom that has prevailed since the beginning of the Government in<br>
accordance with the recommendation of the senators and congressmen of<br>
the majority party, should be relieved from this burden. I am confident<br>
that such a change would greatly reduce the cost of administering the<br>
government and that it would add greatly to its efficiency. It would<br>
take away the power to use the patronage of the government for political<br>
purposes."<br>
<br>
President Taft took an advance position also in his advocacy of the<br>
substitution of the appeal to reason for the appeal to force in the<br>
settlement of all international difficulties. The treaties of<br>
arbitration which were agreed upon during the summer of 1911 between<br>
Secretary Knox and the representatives of Great Britain and France<br>
illustrate the general type of treaty which the President hoped would be<br>
negotiated with other nations. Heretofore, the treaties to which the<br>
United States has been a party have accepted as suitable for arbitration<br>
all questions save those which concerned "vital interests and national<br>
honor." It was a great step forward, therefore, when the agreement was<br>
reached between the powers that all disputes that are justiciable and<br>
cannot be settled by diplomacy are to be submitted to arbitration.<br>
<br>
In case of a difference on whether the dispute were justiciable or not,<br>
it was to be submitted to a commission of inquiry for decision. If the<br>
commission found it was justiciable the question in dispute must be<br>
submitted to arbitration. Should the commission find it was not<br>
justiciable there would still exist the possibility of war. But either<br>
nation has the power to delay the findings a year during which time<br>
diplomatic action may be resumed. The arguments against the ratification<br>
of these facts in the Senate were based on the plea that they provided<br>
for compulsory arbitration and thus tended to deprive the Senate of its<br>
constitutional prerogative. The wording was so greatly modified in the<br>
Senate that the form of treaty which was finally ratified differed but<br>
little from the arbitration treaties of 1908.<br>

CHAPTER XVI<br>
<br>
THE THIRTEENTH CENSUS, 1910<br>
<br>
[1910-1911]<br>
<br>
After many years of urging on the part of statisticians and public men,<br>
Congress, in 1902, passed a bill which was signed by the President<br>
providing for a permanent census bureau connected with the Department of<br>
Commerce and Labor. This bureau, as shown in the taking of the<br>
thirteenth census, serves to promote both efficiency and economy in the<br>
collection of statistics associated with the census work. Heretofore the<br>
Director of the Census had enormous patronage at his disposal which he<br>
farmed out among congressmen and other political leaders.<br>
<br>
E. Dana Durand, a trained statistician of wide experience, was appointed<br>
Director of the Census. He announced that so far as possible the 65,000<br>
enumerators would be selected under civil service rules and for<br>
supervisors of the census he selected men on the basis of their special<br>
fitness for the work. President Taft was in complete agreement with this<br>
programme and insisted that local enumerators were to be appointed for<br>
the purpose of getting the work properly done and not to assist any<br>
would-be dispensers of local patronage.<br>
<br>
On April 15 the enumerators began their work of gathering statistics.<br>
The usual inquiries were made on population, mortality, agriculture,<br>
manufactures, etc. Prior to April 15, an advance schedule was sent to<br>
practically every farmer in the country, and he was asked to fill it out<br>
before the coming of the enumerator. Similarly, in the cities, the<br>
enumerators distributed advance population schedules which the head of<br>
the family was requested to fill out before the official visit of the<br>
enumerator. In taking the thirteenth census, greater attention was given<br>
than ever before to perfecting the schedules and weighing each question<br>
with regard to its precise significance and scientific value. To that<br>
end a group of trained investigators, familiar with the various topics<br>
which the census would cover, spent several months on a preliminary<br>
study of the character of these questions. In addition to the<br>
nationality of each person as determined by the mother tongue of the<br>
foreign-born inhabitants, additional inquiries were made relative to the<br>
industry in which each person was employed and whether the person was<br>
out of work on April 15.<br>

<br>
<br>
Population schedules in the cities and large towns were required to be<br>
completed within two weeks and in the rural districts within thirty<br>
days. The enormous labor of tabulating and classifying these answers was<br>
then begun by the 3,500 clerks in the Census Office at Washington. Much<br>
of this labor was performed by machines each capable of making 25,000<br>
tabulations a day. Results of the first tabulation of the population in<br>
the cities were made known about June 1 and the count of the principal<br>
cities was completed by April 15. During September the population of the<br>
entire country was made known. Within two years the leading facts in the<br>
census were compiled and published as special bulletins. The entire cost<br>
of the census was about $13,000,000.<br>
<br>
The total population of the United States, including our territorial<br>
possessions and dependencies, was found to be about 101,000,000, thus<br>
for the first time passing the hundred million mark. The population of<br>
the United States proper was 91,972,266; of Alaska, 64,356; Porto Rico,<br>
1,118,012; Hawaii, 191,909; Guam and Samoa, 15,100; the Philippine<br>
Islands about 7,700,000. These numbers indicate an increase in the<br>
population of continental United States of 21 per cent in the decade, or<br>
a slightly larger growth than the 20.7 per cent made during the<br>
preceding ten years.<br>
<br>
One of the striking facts brought out in the census is the absolute<br>
decline in the percentage of population compared with the previous<br>
decade in a number of the States of the East, South, and Middle West,<br>
and an increase of this percentage in the other States, especially among<br>
those of the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Coast. The percentage of<br>
total increase of population in Alabama was 16.9 and the increase,<br>
according to the twelfth census, was 20.8; in Illinois, 16.9 as against<br>
26 for the preceding census; Indiana, 7.3 against 14.8; Kentucky, 6.6<br>
against 15.5; Massachusetts, 20 against 25.3; Minnesota, 18.5 against<br>
33.7; Texas, 27.8 against 36.4; Montana, 54.5 against 70. Iowa showed an<br>
actual loss of three-tenths per cent of her inhabitants, while according<br>
to the preceding census there was a gain of 16.7 per cent in that State.<br>
In the following States the gains in percentages were as follows: North<br>
Dakota, 80.8 against 67.1 for 1900; South Dakota, 45.4 and 15.2; Kansas,<br>
15 and 3; Nebraska, 11.8 and 0.3; Colorado, 48 and 30.6; Oklahoma,<br>
109.7; Utah, 34.9 and 31.3; Nevada, 93.4 and 10.6; Idaho, 101.3 and<br>
82.7; Washington, 120.4 and 45; Oregon, 62.7 and 30.2, and California,<br>
60.1 and 22.4.<br>
<br>
In numerical advance, New York, Pennsylvania, California, Texas, and<br>
Illinois led. The increase in New York was nearly 2,000,000, in<br>
Pennsylvania over 1,000,000, and in the other three States nearly<br>
900,000 each.<br>
<br>
Another notable fact brought out by the thirteenth census was that the<br>
growth of the cities was greater than during the preceding ten years.<br>
The rate of growth of the medium-sized cities was more rapid than that<br>
of the large cities. This was not the case during the preceding decade.<br>
Of the total population of continental United States, 46.3 per cent were<br>
urban. That is, 42,623,383 of the inhabitants resided in cities and<br>
towns having a population of 2,500 or more. The same territory in 1900<br>
and 1890, similarly classified as urban, contained 40.5 and 36.1 per<br>
cent, respectively, of the total population of the country. In all but<br>
two States, Montana and Wyoming, the urban population has increased<br>
faster than the rural population. The increase, since 1900, in the<br>
population living in urban territory was 11,035,841 or 34.9 per cent,<br>
while the increase in population living in rural territory during the<br>
same period was 4,941,850 or 11.1 per cent. For the United States as a<br>
whole, therefore, the rate of increase for the population of urban areas<br>
was three times that for the population living in rural territory. In<br>
the States of the east north-central division, including Ohio, Indiana,<br>
Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, the urban gain was 31.2 per cent, but<br>
there was a decrease in rural population of 0.2 per cent. The urban<br>
increase of Illinois was 31.2 per cent, but the rural territory of the<br>
State showed a loss of 7.5 per cent. The rural loss in Indiana was 5.5<br>
per cent, and in Ohio 1.3 per cent. Michigan's rural gain was 2 per cent<br>
and Wisconsin's 5.7. per cent. There were fourteen States in which more<br>
than one-half of the population in 1910 were living in urban territory.<br>
Among these States were Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut<br>
with nine-tenths of their population urban; Illinois with 62 per cent,<br>
and Ohio with 56 per cent.<br>

<br>
<br>
The rapid growth of our industrial and manufacturing interests during<br>
the past quarter of a century is shown by the fact that 22 per cent of<br>
the people of the country are massed in cities of 100,000 inhabitants<br>
and over. In the three largest cities alone--New York, Chicago, and<br>
Philadelphia--there are almost one-tenth the population of the whole<br>
country. There were five cities with populations between 500,000 and<br>
1,000,000; eleven between 250,000 and 500,000; 31 between 100,000 and<br>
250,000; 59 between 50,000 and 100,000; 120 between 25,000 and 50,000;<br>
374 between 10,000 and 20,000; 629 between 5,000 and 10,000, and 1,173<br>
between 2,500 and 5,000.<br>
<br>
The thirteenth census revealed but slight change in the location of the<br>
centre of population. In computing its position, no account of the<br>
population of Alaska and of our insular possessions was taken into<br>
consideration. It had moved west about 39 miles and northward<br>
seven-tenths of a mile and was located at Bloomington in southern<br>
Indiana. The westward movement from 1900 to 1910 was nearly three times<br>
as great as from 1890 to 1900, but was less than that for any decade<br>
between 1840 and 1890. This advance of the centre of population toward<br>
the West was due to the increase in the population of the Pacific Coast<br>
States. The large increase in the population of New York, Pennsylvania,<br>
Illinois, and other States north of the thirty-ninth parallel served as<br>
a balance to the increase in Texas, Oklahoma, and southern California.<br>
<br>
During the past fifteen years there has been a steady migration from the<br>
rural portions of the United States to the western provinces of Canada,<br>
not less than 650,000 immigrants having crossed the border within that<br>
period. Most of them have become naturalized Canadians. It has been<br>
estimated that these immigrants took with them, on an average, $1,000.<br>
<br>
According to the congressional reapportionment act following the twelfth<br>
census, there were to be 386 members in the House of Representatives or<br>
one representative to 194,182 of the population. The House of<br>
Representatives actually contained 391 members after the admission of<br>
Oklahoma. By the census of 1910, several States were entitled to<br>
additional members, but in order that no State should be reduced in the<br>
number of its representatives, the House of Representatives passed a<br>
bill providing for an increase of 42 members. The new ratio of<br>
representation would then be one representative to 211,877<br>
inhabitants. Effort was made to prevent this increase, for it was argued<br>
that the House had already become unwieldy, requiring great effort on<br>
the part of members to make themselves heard. The bill failed to pass<br>
the Senate at the regular session, but subsequently, at the special<br>
session, it became a law. Party lines were closely drawn in the Senate,<br>
for, on account of this increase, the Republicans would probably gain 32<br>
new congressmen and the Democrats only 10. By this reapportionment the<br>
northeastern part of the country and the extreme western and<br>
southwestern portions gained in their representation. New York gained<br>
six representatives; Pennsylvania, four; California and Oklahoma, three<br>
each; Illinois, Massachusetts, Washington, and Texas each gained two,<br>
and sixteen other States each gained one.<br>
<br>
The number of farms, according to the thirteenth census, were 6,340,357<br>
or an increase of about 10 per cent over the number reported in 1900.<br>
There was an increase of 63,000,000 acres devoted to farming during the<br>
decade. About 60 per cent of the farms of the country were operated by<br>
their owners and two-thirds of these farms were free from mortgages. Two<br>
million three hundred and forty-nine thousand two hundred and fifty-four<br>
farms were worked by tenants and 57,398 were in charge of managers. The<br>
tenant system was shown to be far more common in the South than at the<br>
North or West. In the south central group of States, which includes a<br>
large part of the cotton area, the tenants numbered 1,024,265 and the<br>
owners 949,036. In the south Atlantic States there were 591,478 owners<br>
and 118,678 tenants; in north Central States, 1,563,386 owners and<br>
644,493 tenants, and in the Western States, 309,057 owners and 52,164<br>
tenants.<br>
<br>
Our foreign commerce for the year 1910 amounted in the aggregate to<br>
about $3,500,000,000, or over $1,250,000,000 more than in 1900. Our<br>
exports were valued at $2,000,000,000.<br>

THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT<br>
<br>
[1911]<br>
<br>
From time to time it has been charged that "government by the people"<br>
has become fiction in our country. Little had been done to remedy this<br>
condition until the opening of the last decade. Trouble then came for<br>
the supporters of the regular political order, manifesting itself in<br>
conventions and legislatures. Laws abolishing nominations by the<br>
convention method were passed in some States; and publicity of campaign<br>
expenses was insisted upon in others. The movement was widespread and<br>
arose from various causes, but generally tended toward a single end--a<br>
government according to popular will. The Western States have been the<br>
centre of the more radical movement.<br>
<br>
The Senate has always been considered as the stronghold of the most<br>
conservative element in our country and has often been accused of being<br>
the stronghold of privilege. It is interesting to note the success of<br>
the progressive or insurgent movement in this body.<br>
<br>

Robert M. La Follette.<br>
<br>
<br>
The first progressive, Robert M. La Follette, of Wisconsin, appeared in<br>
the United States Senate in 1905. He had done much, as governor, to gain<br>
the confidence of the people of his own State, and he was sent to<br>
Washington to carry his fight for reform into the national legislature.<br>
Here his reception was not cordial. He was looked upon as a radical,<br>
possibly a visionary reformer, but not exceedingly dangerous, for he was<br>
alone. He stood alone until the election of 1908, when nine more<br>
progressives took their seats; in 1910 the number jumped to sixteen.<br>
Here a change came which probably caused the conservatives in the Senate<br>
some worry. The tariff of 1909 had been passed by a Republican Congress.<br>
The results of the elections of 1910 made it appear that the people were<br>
not convinced that this act was an honest redemption of the Republican<br>
campaign promises, for in the Senate which assembled in April, 1911,<br>
there were twenty-nine thorough-going progressives and five other<br>
members who were more progressive than conservative in their views. They<br>
represented twenty-five States. Six of the thirty-four came from the<br>
South; three came from the East, and the remaining twenty-five from the<br>
West. Of the conservatives only eighteen came from the West.<br>
<br>
The same changes may be found in the House of Representatives. These<br>
changes are not so important as the change which must come in the<br>
sentiment of the federal judiciary. From 1901 to 1909 the Executive was<br>
in the control of the progressives and the President was able to get<br>
some important laws passed by a reactionary Congress, but in some<br>
instances the courts annulled these laws.<br>
<br>
The appointment of justices of the district courts of the United States<br>
is to a degree influenced by the senators in the district in which the<br>
appointment is to be made. When these senators are conservative it is<br>
natural that the candidates recommended by them should be conservative<br>
and should entertain no legal theories interfering with the exalted<br>
position of property rights. Should the various States be represented by<br>
progressives, different recommendations will naturally follow and<br>
probably an interpretation of the Constitution which will accord a new<br>
standing to personal rights.<br>
<br>
In the early part of 1911 the movement crystallized into a regular<br>
political organization which called itself The National Progressive<br>
Republican League, with the following platform:<br>
<br>
(1) direct primaries; (2) popular election of delegates to the national<br>
convention; (3) election of senators by direct vote of the people; (4)<br>
initiative, referendum, and recall; (5) an effective corrupt practices<br>
act.<br>
<br>
These points were not new; most of them are incorporated into the body<br>
of law of the State of Oregon. Most progressive Democrats as well as<br>
Republicans seem willing to support these principles. In almost every<br>
State the movement for the direct primaries has met studied opposition.<br>
The "practical politician" or the professional politician seems to hate<br>
to see the old convention system of nominations go. There are many who<br>
object to the election of senators by direct vote, claiming that the<br>
people are not capable of choosing wisely in such cases. The direct<br>
election of delegates to the national conventions is no more than the<br>
prerogative now exercised by the voter when he casts his vote for the<br>
presidential electors. To his mind it means that he is voting for the<br>
candidates themselves. In the vote for delegates to the conventions the<br>
voter is accorded the right to express his preference for men to be<br>
candidates. The corrupt practices plank deserves commendation. It cannot<br>
be made too strong, for every attempt to do away with the irregular,<br>
vicious methods used is a step toward good government.<br>
<br>
The plank which arouses the greatest opposition is that which<br>
incorporates the initiative, referendum, and recall. All three are<br>
devices to make the machinery of popular government more directly<br>
respondent to the popular will. The "initiative" is a process by which<br>
laws are proposed on the petition of a certain specified number of<br>
voters for action either by the legislature or by the direct vote of the<br>
people through a referendum. The "referendum" allows a popular vote upon<br>
acts passed by the legislature--that is, a bill passed by the<br>
legislature may not become a law unless sanctioned by a popular vote, if<br>
a vote is called for by a specified number of voters. The "recall" gives<br>
the voters an opportunity to relieve a man of his office if by a regular<br>
vote it is demonstrated that such an officer has not performed the<br>
duties of his office to the satisfaction of his constituents. These<br>
expedients are still in the experimental stage, and it is doubtful<br>
whether they are so fraught with danger as their opponents seem to<br>
believe or so efficacious as their adherents insist. Much of their<br>
success depends upon the cases to which they are applied and upon the<br>
popular interest displayed. The Oregon experiments apparently have been<br>
very successful.<br>
<br>
The question of the "recall" is a serious one. In some<br>
municipalities--Los Angeles, for example--it has operated well. How it<br>
will work in the national government, where it will affect the<br>
judiciary, is a problem. The veto of the Statehood Bill (Arizona and New<br>
Mexico) on account of the presence of the "recall" for judges in the<br>
constitution of Arizona shows that President Taft is a stout opponent.<br>
It seems well that any such step should be taken with extreme caution.<br>
<br>
The progressive senators were active in their opposition to the<br>
Payne-Aldrich Tariff Bill of 1909. For a period of twelve years there<br>
had been no tariff legislation. The great industrial changes which went<br>
on during that time made a revision of the Dingley Tariff imperative.<br>
Although there has been a constant demand for revision, the tariff<br>
played no part in the campaigns of 1900 and 1904. The demand has become<br>
insistent, however, during recent years, and may be attributed in part<br>
to the increased cost of living. This demand, made chiefly by the<br>
wage-earners and salaried men, has been seconded from another quarter.<br>
The attitude of foreign nations toward our goods has made it<br>
increasingly difficult for American manufacturers to dispose of their<br>
surplus. Wages have risen; the price of raw material is higher, and both<br>
affect the manufacturer. Foreign nations have refused to accept our high<br>
tariffs without retaliation, and this has made the manufacturer insist<br>
that Congress revise the objectionable Dingley act.<br>
<br>
The agitation took definite form during the session of 1907-8 when the<br>
National Manufacturers' Association undertook to secure legislation<br>
designed to create a tariff commission composed of experts whose<br>
business it should be to ascertain the facts concerning the condition of<br>
manufacturers and the necessity of a new tariff. Pursuant to this the<br>
Beveridge Tariff Commission Bill was introduced into the Senate, but the<br>
leaders of both houses--Cannon, Aldrich, Payne, and others--said bluntly<br>
that it was bad politics to take the question up just before a<br>
presidential campaign, and nothing was done. The demand grew more<br>
insistent, and the wary leaders learned in time that it would be good<br>
politics at least to declare for tariff revision, and this was done by<br>
Chairman Payne of the Ways and Means committee of the House. Just when<br>
the revision would come was not stated--some time after election,<br>
provided the nation would return the Republicans to power.<br>

<br>
<br>
When the session closed Chairman Payne set on foot a series of<br>
investigations ostensibly to gain information to be used in the coming<br>
revision. It is possible that this was also an attempt to end the<br>
criticism aimed at the leaders who had opposed the appointment of a<br>
commission. Both the Democratic and Republican platforms of 1908<br>
promised tariff revision, but of course in different ways. The<br>
Republican leaders said the policy of the party would be to fix the<br>
duties at a point which would not only offset the higher cost of<br>
production in this country, but would also guarantee to the<br>
manufacturers a fair profit. The election put the conservatives of the<br>
Republican party in control of all branches of the government, and when<br>
the principal committees of both houses of Congress fell under the<br>
control of men fully committed to the dogma of protection, the chance<br>
for a revision downward seemed slight. A special session was called soon<br>
after President Taft's inauguration, and the Payne Bill, which it was<br>
claimed aimed to decrease duties and increase the revenue, passed the<br>
House by a vote of 217 to 161.<br>
<br>
The Finance Committee of the Senate, to which the bill was referred when<br>
it reached the Senate, instead of reporting it, reported a substitute<br>
measure--the Aldrich Bill. This the House refused to accept and the<br>
usual conference committee was organized, out of which committee came<br>
the compromise Payne-Aldrich Bill, destined to become law through the<br>
President's signature, August 5, 1909.<br>
<br>
The debate in the Senate was a noteworthy one. The progressive senators<br>
of the Middle West, led by Dolliver, of Iowa, and La Follette, of<br>
Wisconsin, fought the measure sturdily, but with little success.<br>
"Jokers" slipped in here and there, and more than one critic has charged<br>
that the Senate was less solicitous for the rights of the consumers than<br>
for the rights of the "interests."<br>
<br>
Several schedules have come in for the most severe kind of criticism. In<br>
the cotton schedule the increased rates laid upon certain classes of<br>
cotton goods seem to have been imposed for the benefit of New England<br>
manufacturers. These rates affect articles used by every person in the<br>
United States. Most of these articles are manufactured from raw material<br>
produced in America, and the cost of manufacturing the staple articles<br>
is but slightly higher than in any of the important competing countries.<br>
The average rate imposed by the Dingley Tariff, according to the Bureau<br>
of Statistics, was 38 per cent on cotton cloth and similar rates on<br>
other cotton goods. Since 1897 the "infant industries" have grown, and<br>
some have in recent years declared dividends of 66 per cent per annum.<br>
The Payne-Aldrich Bill increased the average rate on cotton goods from<br>
44.84 per cent in the Dingley Tariff to 50.62 per cent. The increases<br>
are not so much on the high-priced goods as on the cheaper grades.<br>
<br>
In the case of the wool schedule the object of criticism has been the<br>
discrimination against the carded woollen industry, which produces the<br>
poor man's cloth, in favor of the worsted industry. This is due to the<br>
imposition of a uniform duty of eleven cents per pound on raw, unwashed<br>
wool, by which the cheaper woollens are taxed as high as 500 per cent,<br>
and frequently amounts to less than 25 per cent on the finer grades.<br>
Based on this system of duties is a graded scale in which the rates rise<br>
in an inverse ratio with the value of the goods. Some duties have been<br>
lowered, but the change has been slight. The schedule remains nearly the<br>
same, but the burden has been shifted.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
There are reductions--more, numerically, than increases--but the<br>
reductions are effectively modified by shifted classifications.<br>
<br>
One thinker of note has termed the "maximum and minimum" clause as "the<br>
highest practical joke of the whole bill." Little has been said of this<br>
clause except in connection with the "minimum." It must be remembered<br>
that there is also a "maximum," and it does not augur well for the<br>
consumer. Suppose a foreign nation discriminates against our goods; we,<br>
acting on the "maximum" theory, discriminate against theirs, and the<br>
result is that the consumer pays the value of the article plus the<br>
amount of the tariff of discrimination, since it has ever been true that<br>
the limit in price is the top of the tariff wall.<br>
<br>
A noteworthy feature of the bill is the provision for the formation of a<br>
Tariff Board, composed of experts, who shall conduct investigations with<br>
the view of evolving a scientific tariff. The board has little power<br>
save that of advising the President in the application of the "maximum<br>
and minimum" clause.<br>
<br>
That the tariff has not been deemed an honest redemption of Republican<br>
campaign pledges is shown by the recent elections. In the Sixty-first<br>
Congress there were 219 Republicans in the House of Representatives and<br>
172 Democrats; to the Sixty-second Congress there were returned 162<br>
Republicans and 228 Democrats.<br>
<br>
The Democrats at once began a revision of the tariff. Allied with the<br>
progressives in the Senate, revisions of the wool and cotton schedules<br>
were brought about. The Farmers' Free List Bill, which admitted free of<br>
duty agricultural implements, sewing-machines, boots, shoes, fence wire,<br>
and other things useful to farmers, was passed as an offset to the<br>
Reciprocity Bill which was deemed by some to be disadvantageous to them.<br>
The President vetoed all of these measures upon the ground that, since<br>
the Tariff Board was to make its report within a very short time, it<br>
would be wiser to defer action on the tariff until the report could be<br>
used.<br>
<br>
The Reciprocity Bill, which met the approval of the President, provided<br>
that our markets should be free to Canada's leading agricultural<br>
products, live-stock, fish, lumber, etc. Print paper and wood pulp were<br>
also to be admitted as soon as the Canadian provincial governments<br>
should withdraw the restrictions upon the exportation of these products.<br>
The duties on some other products--iron ore, for example--were to be<br>
reduced. Canada was asked to admit free our agricultural products,<br>
live-stock, etc., and to reduce the duties on coal, agricultural<br>
implements, and some other manufactured goods. The September elections<br>
in Canada, however, showed that the reciprocity treaty was not<br>
acceptable, for the Conservative party, which was strongly opposed to<br>
the plan, gained a decisive victory. The act as passed by Congress still<br>
remains law in the United States, and stands as a constant invitation to<br>
our Canadian neighbors to join us in developing commercial relations on<br>
the western continent.<br>
<br>
What effect will this Progressive movement have upon party organization?<br>
As matters stand at present there are in reality four parties within the<br>
bonds of the two old parties--(1) the Conservative Republicans of the<br>
East; (2) the Conservative Democrats of the South; (3) the Progressive<br>
Republicans of the West; (4) the Progressive Democrats of the West. Out<br>
of this tangle it appears that either a new party will be formed by the<br>
combination of the Progressives of both old parties, or this Progressive<br>
movement must gain control of one or the other of these parties. Should<br>
the former&nbsp; happen, we may see the peculiar alliance of New
England and<br>
the South.<br>
<br>
President Taft, it is maintained by many of his supporters, is himself a<br>
Progressive, and they point to his attitude toward the great questions<br>
of the hour. He urged, they say, reciprocity with Canada; called for<br>
revision of the tariff in the light of facts and scientific tests;<br>
proclaimed unlimited arbitration; advocated the conservation of our<br>
natural resources, income taxation, extension of civil service reform,<br>
employers' liability, and economy in the administration of governmental<br>
affairs.<br>
<br>
In answer it is asserted that President Taft declared the Payne-Aldrich<br>
tariff law to be the best ever passed upon the subject, and that his<br>
advisers and supporters in all of the congressional contests over vital<br>
measures were the senators and representatives known as reactionaries or<br>
standpatters.<br>
<br>
[1912]<br>
<br>
President Taft himself, a few months before the convening of the<br>
Republican convention called to meet in Chicago, June 16, 1912, stated<br>
his honesty of intention in the following words: "I am very grateful for<br>
the honors the people have given me. I do not affect to deny the<br>
satisfaction I should feel if, after casting up the totals pro and con<br>
and striking a balance, they should decide that my first term had been<br>
fruitful enough of good to warrant their enlisting me for another. Any<br>
man would be proud of such a verdict. But I have not been willing, nor<br>
shall I be, to purchase it at the sacrifice of my freedom to do my duty<br>
as I see it. My happiness is not dependent on holding any office, and I<br>
shall go back to private life with no heartburnings if the people,<br>
after an unprejudiced review of my administration, conclude that some<br>
one else can serve them to their greater advantage."<br>
<br>
One thing is certain: the idea of government by the people has come into<br>
our national politics to stay. It now controls one-third of the votes in<br>
the Senate and has affected the laws of two-thirds of the States. The<br>
end sought is good government responsible to popular rule. Through this<br>
rule justice for all is sought; equality of opportunity in political and<br>
industrial life; the safeguarding of the interests and well-being of<br>
all; and through this rule an honest attempt is being made to establish<br>
a government which will render the best service for the community,<br>
guaranteeing to each individual all his rights, but no more than his<br>
rights.<br>

judgment and punishment, according to law.<br>
<br>
SECT. IV. 1. The times, places and manner of holding elections for<br>

legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or<br>
alter such regulations, except as to the places of choosing Senators.<br>

meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by<br>
law appoint a different day.<br>
<br>
SECT. V. 1. Each house shall be the judge of the elections, returns and<br>

the Senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President<br>
of the United States; if he approve he shall sign, it, but if not he<br>
shall return it with his objections to that house in which it shall have<br>
originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their journal,<br>
and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration two thirds<br>
of that house shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together<br>
with the objections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be<br>
reconsidered, and, if approved by two thirds of that house, It shall<br>
become a law. But in all such cases the votes of&nbsp; both houses
shall be<br>
determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and<br>

respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the President within<br>
ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him,<br>

the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case it<br>
shall not be a law.<br>
<br>
3. Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the<br>
Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a<br>
question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the<br>

from, or enter into any conference, agreement, alliance, or treaty with<br>
any king, prince, or state; nor shall any person holding any office of<br>
profit or trust under the United States, or any of them, accept of any<br>
present, emolument, office, or title of any kind whatever from any king,<br>
prince, or foreign state; nor shall the United States, in Congress<br>
assembled, or any of them, grant any title of nobility.<br>
<br>
No two or more States shall enter into any treaty, confederation, or<br>
alliance whatever between them, without the consent of the United<br>
States, in Congress assembled, specifying accurately the purposes for<br>
which the same is to be entered into, and how long it shall continue.<br>
<br>
No State shall lay any imposts or duties which may interfere with any<br>
stipulations in treaties entered into by the United States, in Congress<br>
assembled, with any king, prince, or state, in pursuance of any treaties<br>
already proposed by Congress to the courts of France and Spain.<br>
<br>
No vessels of war shall be kept up in time of peace by any State, except<br>
such number only as shall be deemed necessary by the United States, in<br>
Congress assembled, for the defense of such State or its trade, nor<br>
shall any body of forces be kept up by any State in time of peace,<br>
except such number only as, in the judgment of the United States, in<br>
Congress assembled, shall be deemed requisite to garrison the forts<br>
necessary for the defense of such State; but every State shall always<br>
keep up a well-regulated and disciplined militia, sufficiently armed and<br>
accoutered, and shall provide and constantly have ready for use in<br>
public stores a due number of field-pieces and tents, and a proper<br>
quantity of arms, ammunition, and camp equipage.<br>
<br>
No State shall engage in any war without the consent of the United<br>
States, in Congress assembled, unless such State be actually invaded by<br>
enemies, or shall have received certain advice of a resolution being<br>
formed by some nation of Indians to invade such State, and the danger is<br>
so imminent as not to admit of a delay till the United States, in<br>
Congress assembled, can be consulted; nor shall any State grant<br>
commissions to any ships or vessels of war, nor letters of marque or<br>
reprisal, except it be after a declaration of war by the United States,<br>
in Congress assembled, and then only against the kingdom or state, and<br>
the subjects thereof, against which war has been so declared, and under<br>
such regulations as shall be established by the United States, in<br>
Congress assembled, unless such State be infested by pirates, in which<br>
case vessels of war may be fitted out for that occasion, and kept so<br>
long as the danger shall continue, or until the United States, in<br>
Congress assembled, shall determine otherwise.<br>
<br>
<br>
ART. VII.--When land forces are raised by any State for the common<br>
defense, all officers of or under the rank of Colonel shall be appointed<br>
by the Legislature of each State respectively by whom such forces shall<br>
be raised, or in such manner as such State shall direct, and all<br>
vacancies shall be filled up by the State which first made the<br>
appointment.<br>
<br>
<br>
ART. VIII.--All charges of war, and all other expenses that shall be<br>
incurred for the common defense, or general welfare, and allowed by the<br>
United States, in Congress assembled, shall be defrayed out of a common<br>
treasury, which shall be supplied by the several States in proportion to<br>
the value of all land within each State, granted to, or surveyed for,<br>
any person, as such land and the buildings and improvements thereon<br>
shall be estimated, according to such mode as the United States, in<br>
Congress assembled, shall, from time to time, direct and appoint. The<br>
taxes for paying that proportion shall be laid and levied by the<br>
authority and direction of the Legislatures of the several States,<br>
within the time agreed upon by the United States, in Congress assembled.<br>
<br>
<br>
ART. IX.--The United States, in Congress assembled, shall have the sole<br>
and exclusive right and power of determining on peace and war, except in<br>
the cases mentioned in the sixth Article; of sending and receiving<br>
ambassadors; entering into treaties and alliances, provided that no<br>
treaty of commerce shall be made, whereby the legislative power of the<br>
respective States shall be restrained from imposing such imposts and<br>
duties on foreigners as their own people are subjected to, or from<br>
prohibiting the exportation or importation of any species of goods or<br>
commodities whatever; of establishing rules for deciding, in all cases,<br>
what captures on land and water shall be legal, and in what manner<br>
prizes taken by land or naval forces in the service of the United States<br>
shall be divided or appropriated; of granting letters of marque and<br>
reprisal in times of peace; appointing courts for the trial of piracies<br>
and felonies committed on the high seas; and establishing courts for<br>
receiving and determining finally appeals in all cases of captures;<br>
provided that no member of Congress shall be appointed a judge of any of<br>
the said courts.<br>
<br>
The United States, in Congress assembled, shall also be the last resort<br>
on appeal in all disputes and differences now subsisting, or that<br>
hereafter may arise between two or more States concerning boundary,<br>
jurisdiction, or any other cause whatever; which authority shall always<br>
be exercised in the manner following: Whenever the legislative or<br>
executive authority, or lawful agent of any State in controversy with<br>
another, shall present a petition to Congress, stating the matter in<br>
question, and praying for a hearing, notice thereof shall be given by<br>
order of Congress to the legislative or executive authority of the other<br>
State in controversy, and a day assigned for the appearance of the<br>
parties by their lawful agents, who shall then be directed to appoint,<br>
by joint consent, commissioners or judges to constitute a court for<br>
hearing and determining the matter in question; but if they cannot<br>
agree, Congress shall name three persons out of each of the United<br>
States, and from the list of such persons each party shall alternately<br>
strike out one, the petitioners beginning, until the number shall be<br>
reduced to thirteen; and from that number not less than seven nor more<br>
than nine names, as Congress shall direct, shall, in the presence of<br>
Congress, be drawn out by lot; and the persons whose names shall be so<br>
drawn, or any five of them, shall be commissioners or judges, to hear<br>
and finally determine the controversy, so always as a major part of the<br>
judges who shall hear the cause shall agree in the determination; and if<br>
either party shall neglect to attend at the day appointed, without<br>
showing reasons which Congress shall judge sufficient, or being present,<br>
shall refuse to strike, the Congress shall proceed to nominate three<br>
persons out of each State, and the secretary of Congress shall strike in<br>
behalf of such party absent or refusing; and the judgment and sentence<br>
of the Court, to be appointed in the manner before prescribed, shall be<br>
final and conclusive; and if any of the parties shall refuse to submit<br>
to the authority of such Court, or to appear or defend their claim or<br>
cause, the court shall nevertheless proceed to pronounce sentence or<br>
judgment, which shall in like manner be final and decisive; the judgment<br>
or sentence and other proceedings being in either case transmitted to<br>
Congress, and lodged among the acts of Congress for the security of the<br>
parties concerned; provided, that every commissioner, before he sits in<br>
judgment, shall take an oath, to be administered by one of the judges of<br>
the supreme or superior court of the State where the cause shall be<br>
tried, "well and truly to hear and determine the matter in question,<br>
according to the best of his judgment, without favor, affection, or hope<br>
of reward." Provided, also, that no State shall be deprived of territory<br>
for the benefit of the United States.<br>
<br>
All controversies concerning the private right of soil claimed under<br>
different grants of two or more States, whose jurisdictions, as they may<br>
respect such lands, and the States which passed such grants are<br>
adjusted, the said grants or either of them being at the same time<br>
claimed to have originated antecedent to such settlement of<br>
jurisdiction, shall, on the petition of either party to the Congress of<br>
the United States, be finally determined, as near as may be, in the same<br>
manner as is before prescribed for deciding disputes respecting<br>
territorial jurisdiction between different States.<br>
<br>
The United States, in Congress assembled, shall also have the sole and<br>
exclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value of coin<br>
struck by their own authority, or by that of the respective States;<br>
fixing the standard of weights and measures throughout the United<br>
States; regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians,<br>
not members of any of the States; provided that the legislative right of<br>
any State, within its own limits, be not infringed or violated;<br>
establishing and regulating post offices from one State to another,<br>
throughout all the United States, and exacting such postage on the<br>
papers passing through the same as may be requisite to defray the<br>
expenses of the said office; appointing all officers of the land forces<br>
in the service of the United States, excepting regimental officers;<br>
appointing all the officers of the naval forces, and commissioning all<br>
officers whatever in the service of the United States; making rules for<br>
the government and regulation of the said land and naval forces, and<br>
directing their operations.<br>
<br>
The United States, in Congress assembled, shall have authority to<br>
appoint a committee, to sit in the recess of Congress, to be denominated<br>
"A Committee of the States," and to consist of one delegate from each<br>
State, and to appoint such other committees and civil officers as may be<br>
necessary for managing the general affairs of the United States under<br>
their direction; to appoint one of their number to preside; provided<br>
that no person be allowed to serve in the office of president more than<br>
one year in any term of three years; to ascertain the necessary sums of<br>
money to be raised for the service of the United States, and to<br>
appropriate and apply the same for defraying the public expenses; to<br>
borrow money or emit bills on the credit of the United States,<br>
transmitting every half year to the respective States an account of the<br>
sums of money so borrowed or emitted; to build and equip a navy; to<br>
agree upon the number of land forces, and to make requisitions from each<br>
State for its quota, in proportion to the number of white inhabitants in<br>
such State, which requisition shall be binding; and thereupon the<br>
Legislature of each State shall appoint the regimental officers, raise<br>
the men, and clothe, arm, and equip them in a soldier-like manner, at<br>
the expense of the United States; and the officers and men so clothed,<br>
armed, and equipped shall march to the place appointed, and within the<br>
time agreed on by the United States, in Congress assembled; but if the<br>
United States, in Congress assembled, shall, on consideration of<br>
circumstances, judge proper that any State should not raise men, or<br>
should raise a smaller number than its quota, and that any other State<br>
should raise a greater number of men than the quota thereof, such extra<br>
number shall be raised, officered, clothed, armed, and equipped in the<br>
same manner as the quota of such State, unless the Legislature of such<br>
State shall judge that such extra number can not be safely spared out of<br>
the same, in which case they shall raise, officer, clothe, arm, and<br>
equip as many of such extra number as they judge can be safely spared,<br>
and the officers and men so clothed, armed, and equipped shall march to<br>
the place appointed, and within the time agreed on by the United States,<br>
in Congress assembled.<br>
<br>
The United States, in Congress assembled, shall never engage in a war,<br>
nor grant letters of marque and reprisal in time of peace, nor enter<br>
into any treaties or alliances, nor coin money, nor regulate the value<br>
thereof, nor ascertain the sums and expenses necessary for the defense<br>
and welfare of the United States, or any of them, nor emit bills, nor<br>
borrow money on the credit of the United States, nor appropriate money,<br>
nor agree upon the number of vessels of war to be built or purchased, or<br>
the number of land or sea forces to be raised, nor appoint a commander<br>
in chief of the army or navy, unless nine States assent to the same, nor<br>
shall a question on any other point, except for adjourning from day to<br>
day, be determined, unless by the votes of a majority of the United<br>
States, in Congress assembled.<br>
<br>
The Congress of the United States shall have power to adjourn to any<br>
time within the year, and to any place within the United States, so that<br>
no period of adjournment be for a longer duration than the space of six<br>
months, and shall publish the journal of their proceedings monthly,<br>
except such parts thereof relating to treaties, alliances, or military<br>
operations as in their judgment require secrecy; and the yeas and nays<br>
of the delegates of each State, on any question, shall be entered on the<br>
journal when it is desired by any delegate; and the delegates of a<br>
State, or any of them, at his or their request, shall be furnished with<br>
a transcript of the said journal except such parts as are above<br>
excepted, to lay before the Legislatures of the several States.<br>
<br>
<br>
ART. X.--The Committee of the States, or any nine of them, shall be<br>
authorized to execute, in the recess of Congress, such of the powers of<br>
Congress as the United States, in Congress assembled, by the consent of<br>
nine States, shall, from time to time, think expedient to vest them<br>
with; provided that no power be delegated to the said Committee, for the<br>
exercise of which, by the Articles of Confederation, the voice of nine<br>
States in the Congress of the United States assembled is requisite.<br>
<br>
<br>
ART. XI.--Canada, acceding to this Confederation, and joining in the<br>
measures of the United States shall be admitted into, and entitled to<br>
all the advantages of this Union; but no other colony shall be admitted<br>
into the same, unless such admission be agreed to by nine States.<br>
<br>
<br>
ART. XII.--All bills of credit emitted, moneys borrowed, and debts<br>
contracted by or under the authority of Congress, before the assembling<br>
of the United States, in pursuance of the present Confederation, shall<br>
be deemed and considered as a charge against the United States, for<br>
payment and satisfaction whereof the said United States and the public<br>
faith are hereby solemnly pledged.<br>
<br>
<br>
ART. XIII.--Every State shall abide by the determinations of the United<br>
States, in Congress assembled, on all questions which by this<br>
Confederation are submitted to them. And the Articles of this<br>
Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union<br>
shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be<br>
made in any of them, unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress<br>
of the United Stares, and be afterwards confirmed by the Legislatures of<br>
every State.<br>
<br>
<br>
AND WHEREAS it hath pleased the great Governor of the world to incline<br>
the hearts of the Legislatures we respectively represent in Congress to<br>
approve of, and to authorize us to ratify, the said Articles of<br>
Confederation and perpetual Union, know ye, that we, the undersigned<br>
delegates, by virtue of the power and authority to us given for that<br>
purpose, do, by these presents, in the name and in behalf of our<br>
respective constituents, fully and entirely ratify and confirm each and<br>
every of the said Articles of Confederation and perpetual Union, and all<br>

<br>
THE <a name="DECLARATION_OF_INDEPENDENCE"></a>DECLARATION OF
INDEPENDENCE<br>
IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776<br>
<br>
THE following preamble and specifications, known as the Declaration of<br>
Independence, accompanied the resolution of Richard Henry Lee, which was<br>
adopted by Congress on the 2d day of July, 1776. This declaration was<br>
agreed to on the 4th, and the transaction is thus recorded in the<br>
Journal for that day:<br>
<br>
"Agreeably to the order of the day, the Congress resolved itself into a<br>
committee of the whole, to take into their further consideration the<br>
Declaration; and, after some time, the president resumed the chair, and<br>
Mr. Harrison reported that the committee have agreed to a Declaration,<br>
which they desired him to report. The Declaration being read, was agreed<br>
to as follows:"<br>
<br>
<br>
A DECLARATION BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES<br>
OF AMERICA, IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED.<br>
<br>
<br>
When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people<br>
to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another,<br>
and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal<br>
station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a<br>
decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should<br>
declare the causes which impel them to the separation.<br>
<br>
We hold these truths to be self-evident--that all men are created equal;<br>
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights;<br>
that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That,<br>
to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving<br>
their just powers from the consent of the governed; that, whenever any<br>
form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of<br>
the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute a new government,<br>
laying its foundations on such principles, and organizing its powers in<br>
such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and<br>
happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long<br>
established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and,<br>
accordingly, all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to<br>
suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by<br>
abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train<br>
of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces<br>
a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it<br>
is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards<br>
for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these<br>
colonies, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter<br>
their former systems of government. The history of the present king of<br>
Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all<br>
having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over<br>
these States. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.<br>
<br>
1. He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary<br>
for the public good.<br>
<br>
2. He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing<br>
importance, unless suspended in their operations till his assent should<br>
be obtained; and, when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend<br>
to them.<br>
<br>
3. He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large<br>
districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of<br>
representation in the Legislature--a right inestimable to them, and<br>
formidable to tyrants only.<br>
<br>
4. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,<br>
uncomfortable, and distant from the repository of their public records,<br>
for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
5. He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing, with<br>
manly firmness, his invasions on the rights of the people.<br>
<br>
6. He has refused, for a long time after such dissolutions, to cause<br>
others to be elected, whereby the legislative powers, incapable of<br>
annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise;<br>
the State remaining, in the meantime, exposed to all the dangers of<br>
invasions from without, and convulsions within.<br>
<br>
7. He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that<br>
purpose obstructing the laws for the naturalization of&nbsp; foreigners;<br>
refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising<br>
the conditions of new appropriations of lands.<br>
<br>
8. He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his<br>
assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.<br>
<br>
9. He has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure on<br>
their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.<br>
<br>
10. He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of<br>
officers, to harass our people and eat out their substance.<br>
<br>
11. He has kept among us in times of peace, standing armies, without the<br>
consent of our Legislatures.<br>
<br>
12. He has affected to render the military independent of, and superior<br>
to, the civil power.<br>
<br>
13. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign<br>
to our constitutions, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent<br>
to their acts of pretended legislation;<br>
<br>
14. For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us;<br>
<br>
15. For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any<br>
murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these States;<br>
<br>
16.&nbsp; For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world;<br>
<br>
17.&nbsp; For imposing taxes on us without our consent;<br>
<br>
18.&nbsp; For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of a trial
by jury;<br>
<br>
19. For transporting us beyond seas, to be tried for pretended offenses;<br>
<br>
20. For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring<br>
province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging<br>
its boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument<br>
for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies.<br>
<br>
21. For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and<br>
altering, fundamentally, the forms of our governments.<br>
<br>
22. For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves<br>
invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.<br>
<br>
23. He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his<br>
protection, and waging war against us.<br>
<br>
24. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burned our towns, and<br>
destroyed the lives of our people.<br>
<br>
25. He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries<br>
to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun<br>
with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the<br>
most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized<br>
nation.<br>
<br>
26. He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high<br>
seas, to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of<br>
their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.<br>
<br>
27. He has excited domestic insurrection among us, and has endeavored to<br>
bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages,<br>
whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all<br>
ages, sexes, and conditions.<br>
<br>
In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in<br>
the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only by<br>
repeated injury. A prince whose character is thus marked by every act<br>
which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.<br>
<br>
Nor have we been wanting in our attentions to our British brethren. We<br>
have warned them, from time to time, of attempts by their legislature to<br>
extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of<br>
the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have<br>
appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured<br>
them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations,<br>
which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.<br>
They, too, have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.<br>
We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our<br>
separation, and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind--enemies in<br>
war; in peace, friends.<br>
<br>
We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America in<br>
general Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world<br>
for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the<br>
authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and<br>
declare that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free<br>
and independent States; that they are absolved from all allegiance to<br>
the British crown, and that all political connection between them and<br>
the state of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved, and<br>
that, as free and independent States, they have full power to levy war,<br>
conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and do all other<br>
acts and things which independent Stales may of right do. And for the<br>
support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of<br>
Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our<br>
fortunes, and our sacred honor.<br>
